<h1>Permissions</h1>

<p>This page outlines permissions for my various works. Please refer to it when using my works!</p>

<p>A couple of broad notes first:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>For assets which require credit, I can be credited as "Zichqec", with the following link: <a href="https://ukagaka.zichqec.com/">https://ukagaka.zichqec.com/</a></p></li>
	<li><p>Some works may have specific permissions/restrictions. Please check the listings/readmes for each work, and follow the specific permissions/restrictions if any are given.</p></li>
	<li><p>Some of the works listed on this website are collaborative. My collaborators may have different permissions than me. Please be sure to respect the permissions given by my collaborators if they are more restrictive, and if you're uncertain of the permissions, please ask us.</p></li>
	<li><p>If you're reading this page through machine translation, here is an explanation of the terms that will be used for each section:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>"You must" - These are things you must do when using one of my works.</p></li>
			<li><p>"You may" - These are things that you can optionally do when using one of my works.</p></li>
			<li><p>"You must not" - These are things you must not do when using one of my works.</p></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>You'll find a few common themes among my permissions. I'll list them here as well, as permissions that generally apply to everything I make.</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>I only allow redistribution and modification for certain types of works. Otherwise, redistribution and modification are not permitted.</p>
		<ul><li><p>If you wish to create a translation for one of my works, please contact me for permission first.</p></ul>
	</li>
	<li><p>I do not want my work used for commercial purposes, especially my drawings.</p></li>
	<li><p>I do not want my work used with generative AI.</p></li>
	<li><p>I do not want my work modified to add nudity or sexual elements.</p></li>
	<li><p>I do not want my work turned into anything discriminatory or political, or used in a project that contains these elements.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Besides this, I also find it frustrating when something I've created has my name stripped off of it and then is spread around. This has happened a few times and is demoralizing. Please take care to credit appropriately, especially if you are making a ghost for a popular fandom.</p>

<p>If there's anything on this page that you're uncertain of, get in contact and I'll clarify!</p>

<p><strong>Note: This section only applies to works listed on the "Freeshells" page of my website, and <em>not</em> to the shells listed on the "Shells" page.</strong></p>
<p>These are shells to create your own works with. They are free to use with the following terms:</p>

<h3>You must</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>Mention in your ghost's readme that you are using my freeshell. I can be credited as "Zichqec", with the following link: <a href="https://ukagaka.zichqec.com/">https://ukagaka.zichqec.com/</a></p></li>
	<li><p>Keep the readme file that is included with the freeshell as-is. (Exception: the file can be renamed if needed, such as if combining the shell with another freeshell.)</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>You may</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>Modify the shells, including recoloring, drawing new expressions, combining expressions, scaling the images, mirroring the images, etc. (If the shell is drawn in a pixel style, please take care when scaling. They'll look best if you keep the pixels sharp!)</p></li>
	<li><p>Modify the settings files in any way you need.</p></li>
	<li><p>Combine them with other freeshells.</p></li>
	<li><p>Use the shell to create a thumbnail image for the ghost, or a preview image for use on the ghost's release page, etc.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><p>Use these freeshells to create commercial works.</p></li>
	<li><p>Distribute any version of these freeshells on their own.</p></li>
	<li><p>Use these shells for works outside the realm of ukagaka.</p></li>
	<li><p>Modify these shells to be discriminatory or political, or use them in works that contain these elements.</p></li>
	<li><p>Modify these shells to add nudity or sexual elements.</p></li>
	<li><p>Use AI tools to modify the artwork in these shells.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="balloons">Balloons</h2>

<p>These permissions pertain to bundling one of my balloons with one of your ghosts. I allow my balloons to be redistributed when bundled with a ghost, but otherwise, please do not redistribute them.</p>

<h3>You must</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>Keep the readme and craftman information of the balloon as-is.</p></li>
	<li><p>List any modifications you made in your ghost's readme.</p></li>
	<li><p>If you have made modifications to the balloon, rename the directory used in install.txt to avoid overwriting other versions of the balloon. (You might consider a format such as balloonname_ghostname.)</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>You may</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>Make modifications to these balloons. Modifications include but are not limited to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Font changes</p></li>
		<li><p>Font size changes</p></li>
		<li><p>Hue shifting / changing the colors</p></li>

		<li><p>Combining different balloons into one</p></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>You must not</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>Distribute any version of these balloons on their own, modified or unmodified.</p></li>

<h2 id="templates">Templates</h2>

<h3>You may</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>Use these templates to create any ukagaka you like.</p></li>
	<li><p>Combine these templates with other templates.</p></li>
	<li><p>Take code from these templates to use as part of other projects. (I would appreciate a credit, particularly if you're taking a large piece of code!)</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>You must not</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>Use the art/writing assets present in the templates as part of your creation. The shells provided are <em>not</em> freeshells and should not be treated as such.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>This note is specifically for ghost and shell templates. My balloon and calendar skin templates may be used with the same permissions as my other balloons/calendar skins.</p></li>

<h2 id="code">Code</h2>

<p><strong>This applies to both the "Functions" and "Minigames" pages of this website.</strong></p>

<p>If the following permissions are not acceptable to you, you are always free to study my code and write your own implementation.</p>

<p>You may make any modifications to the code that you want.</p>

<p>Please add a credit to your readme if you are using a larger piece of code that is visible to the user, such as a minigame or my music player code.</p>

<p>For pieces of code which are not apparent to the user, such as my function to scrape SakuraScript tags out of dialogue, simply leaving my "Written by Zichqec" comment at the top of the function is sufficient so that people can trace it back to the source.</p>

<p>For tiny pieces of code (only a few lines long) no credit is required.</p>

<h2 id="free_assets">Free assets</h2>

<p>Please note that permissions here may vary greatly depending on the asset. But in general:</p>

<h3>You must</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>Check if the asset you want to use requires credit. Some of them do, and some of them do not.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>You may</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>Modify the assets to suit your project (changing colors, hue shifting, cropping, transforming, etc.)</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>You must not</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>Use these assets for works outside of ukagaka. (i.e., don't use them for Shimeji, other types of desktop toy, or anything else that is not ukagaka.)</p></li>
	<li><p>Redistribute these assets on their own.</p></li>
	<li><p>Use these assets for commercial works.</p></li>
	<li><p>Modify these assets to be anything discriminatory or political.</p></li>
	<li><p>Use AI tools to modify these assets.</p></li>
</ul>
