<h1>Permissions</h1>

<p>This page outlines permissions for my various works. Please refer to it when using my works!</p>

<p>A couple of broad notes first:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>For assets which require credit, I can be credited as "Zichqec", with the following link: <a href="https://ukagaka.zichqec.com/">https://ukagaka.zichqec.com/</a></p></li>
	<li><p>Some works may have specific permissions. Please check the listings/readmes for each work, and follow the specific permissions if any are given.</p></li>
	<li><p>Some of the works listed on this website are collaborative. My collaborators may have different permissions than me. Please be sure to respect the permissions given by my collaborators if they are more restrictive, and if you're uncertain of the permissions, please ask us.</p></li>
	<li><p>I may update this list from time to time. It may be a good idea to check it immediately before using one of my assets.</p></li>
	<li><p>If you're reading this page through machine translation, here is an explanation of the terms that will be used for sections about using free assets:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>"You must" - These are things you must do when using one of my works.</p></li>
			<li><p>"You may" - These are things that you can optionally do when using one of my works.</p></li>
			<li><p>"You must not" - These are things you must not do when using one of my works.</p></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>You'll find a few common themes among my permissions. I'll list them here as well, as permissions that generally apply to everything I make.</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>I only allow redistribution and modification for certain types of works. Otherwise, redistribution and modification are not permitted.</p>
		<ul><li><p>If you wish to create a translation for one of my works, please contact me for permission first.</p></ul>
	</li>
	<li><p>I do not want my work used for commercial purposes, especially my drawings.</p></li>
	<li><p>I provide free-to-use assets for the exclusive use of the ukagaka community, and do not want them used outside of this context. (That means they cannot be used for things such as Shimeji, video streaming, website decorations, etc., without express permission.)</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Code assets (including SAORI and tools) are exempt from this. If you can find a use for them in a non-ukagaka setting, you may use them.</p></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><p>I do not want my work turned into anything discriminatory or political, or used in a project that contains these elements.</p></li>
	<li><p>I do not want my work modified to add nudity or sexual elements.</p></li>
	<li><p>I do not want my work modified by generative AI tools, or used as training data for generative AI.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Besides this, I also find it frustrating when something I've created has my name stripped off of it and then is spread around. This has happened a few times and is demoralizing. Please take care to credit appropriately, especially if you are making a ghost for a popular fandom.</p>

<p>If there's anything on this page that you're uncertain of, get in contact and I'll clarify!</p>

<h2 id="ghosts">Ghosts</h2>

<p>This section uses a translated and adapted version of the <a href="https://emily.shillest.net/specwiki/index.php?%E7%A5%9E%E5%A4%9C%E3%81%BF%E3%82%85%E3%82%93/%E3%82%B4%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%81%AE%E4%BA%8C%E6%AC%A1%E5%89%B5%E4%BD%9C%E3%82%AC%E3%82%A4%E3%83%89%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3">"ghost copyright awareness" list on the specwiki</a>.</p>

<h3>About secondary works (fanart, etc.)</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>[1. Producing and distributing additional shells, balloons, etc.]</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>OK - But making additional shells is not recommended for ghosts with very specialized shells where more content may be added over time (such as <a href="ghost/keep_frozen.html">KEEP FROZEN</a>).</p></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><p>[2. Creating secondary works.]</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>OK for visual content such as drawings, animations, etc.</p></li>
		<li><p>NG for written content. This includes visual content that has dialogue, such as long comic strips.</p></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><p>[3. Secondary works that contain NSFW/R-18/R-18G content (sexual content or gore).]</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>NG - However, note that moderate injury and blood does not fall under this category and is therefore allowed.</p></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><p>[4. Depicting the ghost in secondary works that are far removed from the original setting.]</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>OK - Original reimaginings are welcome. However, <strong>please take great care when representing my characters as secondary works for another media.</strong> I would prefer this not be done in a lot of cases.</p>
		<ul>
		<li><p>It can be hurtful when it comes across as someone taking my original work and making it more palatable for themself by changing it to a media they are familiar with. Please consider whether what you are making is something you know that <em>I or my collaborators</em> will enjoy, or whether it is made for <em>your own</em> enjoyment.</p></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><p>[5. Selling secondary works.]</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>NG</p></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><p>[6. Asking for ghost-related works to be created through commission services, etc.]</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>NG when requesting that others make commissions related to my works.</p></li>
		<li><p>OK when requesting commissions from me, but it is unlikely I will accept.</p></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Handling of ghosts and other distributed data</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>[1. Linking directly to the ghost download page or archive.]</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Please link to the ghost's page on my website. If no page is available, you may link to the GitHub Releases page for the ghost. If neither is available, please contact me.</p></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><p>[2. Registering the ghost on external sites such as information aggregation sites (Ghost Captor Sakura, etc.).]</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>OK</p></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><p>[3. Redistributing ghosts that are currently available or have been discontinued.]</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>NG</p></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><p>[4. Redistributing ghosts after modifying their contents (dictionary, shell, etc.)]</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>NG - However, some translation work may be permitted. Please contact me for permission first.</p></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><p>[5. Producing/distributing additional shells that use the materials of the master shell.]</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>NG - However, in cases where I have used a freeshell, you may use it provided you follow the guidelines of the freeshell.</p></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>[1. Giving critical feedback about ghosts.]</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>OK within reason.</p></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><p>[2. Ghost-related feature requests.]</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>OK - You may make reasonable requests, but they may not be implemented.</p></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><p>[3. Revealing spoilers in public.]</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>OK - Please mark them with a spoiler warning if you can.</p></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><p>[4. Publicly sharing quotes from dialogues or screenshots that are taken.]</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>OK</p></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><p>[5. Using shells, balloons, and other images as materials (for SNS icons, etc.)]</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>NG - However, if the ghost is made using a freeshell, then the permissions are that of the freeshell.</p></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><p>[6. Showing ghosts within videos.]</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>OK - But please do not make monetized videos centered around my ghosts. A mention or brief showing of my ghost in a monetized video is fine, but making money from a video in which my ghost is the main focus is not.</p></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><p>[7. Modifying any ghost materials (images, writing, code) with generative AI tools, or using them as training data for generative AI.]</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>NG</p></li>
	</ul>
	</li>

<h2 id="shells">Shells</h2>
<p><strong>Note: This section only applies to works listed on the "Shells" page of my website, and <em>not</em> to the shells listed on the "Freeshells" page.</strong></p>
<p>These are shells which are created for specific ghosts, rather than shells to create your own works with.</p>

<p><strong>I do not allow these shells to be modified or redistributed.</strong></p>

<p>Permissions for these shells are the same as for my <a href="#ghosts">ghosts</a>, except in cases where the permissions of the ghost that the shell is made for are stricter. Please be sure to check the ghost's permissions as well, especially if I am not the author of the ghost.</p>

<h3>If I have created a shell for your ghost</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>Feel free to add custom dialogue or behavior to your ghost based on the shell.</p></li>
	<li><p>Feel free to list my shell on your ghost's website page, etc. Please be sure to link to the shell's page on my website and not a direct download. If no page is available, please contact me.</p></li>
	<li><p>Please do not bundle it with the ghost's nar file unless I have given express permission to do so. I'd prefer that my shells be obtained separately!</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>This also applies to using commands in SSP to automatically install the shell by downloading it from the internet, etc. I would like the user to be directed to my website to obtain any shells I make, so that they can see it in full context.</p></li>

<h2 id="freeshells">Freeshells</h2>
<p><strong>Note: This section only applies to works listed on the "Freeshells" page of my website, and <em>not</em> to the shells listed on the "Shells" page.</strong></p>
<p>These are shells to create your own ukagaka works with. They are free to use with the following terms:</p>

<h3>You must</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>Mention in your ghost's readme that you are using my freeshell. I can be credited as "Zichqec", with the following link: <a href="https://ukagaka.zichqec.com/">https://ukagaka.zichqec.com/</a></p></li>
	<li><p>Any modifications made to the content of the freeshell should be noted in your ghost's readme.</p></li>
	<li><p>Keep the readme file that is included with the freeshell as-is. It can be renamed if needed (such as if combining two freeshells together).</p></li>
	<li><p>Keep the craftman information of the freeshell as-is.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>You may</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>Modify the shells, including recoloring, drawing new expressions, combining expressions, scaling the images, mirroring the images, etc. (If the shell is drawn in a pixel style, please take care when scaling. They'll look best if you keep the pixels sharp!)</p></li>
	<li><p>Modify the settings files in any way you need.</p></li>
	<li><p>Combine them with other freeshells.</p></li>
	<li><p>Use the shell to create a thumbnail image for the ghost, or a preview image for use on the ghost's release page, etc.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>You must not</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>Distribute any version of these freeshells on their own.</p></li>
	<li><p>Use these freeshells to create commercial works.</p></li>
	<li><p>Use these freeshells for works outside the realm of ukagaka.</p></li>
	<li><p>Modify these freeshells to be discriminatory or political, or use them in works that contain these elements.</p></li>
	<li><p>Modify these freeshells to add nudity or sexual elements.</p></li>
	<li><p>Use AI tools to modify the artwork in these freeshells.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In the event that a particular freeshell specifies different terms in its readme file, that freeshell's specific permissions take precedence. I would appreciate if you ensure that you are using the latest version of the freeshell, in case the terms have updated.</p>

<p>You don't have to notify me if you use my freeshells, but if you do I would love to see what you've made!</p>

<p><strong>This applies to both the "Functions" and "Minigames" pages of this website.</strong> It also applies to taking code assets from my ghost templates.</p>

<p>If the following permissions are not acceptable to you, you are always free to study my code and write your own implementation.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>You may make any modifications to the code that you want.</p></li>
	<li><p>Please add a credit to your readme if you are using a larger piece of code that is visible to the user, such as a minigame or my music player code.</p></li>
	<li><p>For pieces of code which are not apparent to the user, such as my function to scrape SakuraScript tags out of dialogue, simply leaving my "Written by Zichqec" comment as-is at the top of the function is sufficient so that people can trace it back to the source.</p></li>
	<li><p>For very small/simple pieces of code no credit is required.</p></li>

</ul>

<h3>You may</h3>
<ul>

</ul>

<h3>You must not</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>Distribute any version of these free assets on their own.</p></li>

<p>In the event that a particular free asset specifies different terms in its readme file, that free asset's specific permissions take precedence. I would appreciate if you ensure that you are using the latest version of the free asset, in case the terms have updated.</p>

<p>Because this category includes a variety of types of work, I cannot provide very many permissions here. Please check each work for individual permissions.</p>

<p>For UDLs (Notepad++ syntax highlighting):</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Redistribution of the original UDL is not permitted unless it is no longer being distributed, and I have been out of contact for more than a year.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>The above only applies in cases where a link rots on its own, and not in cases where I have intentionally stopped distribution.</p></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><p>Unless I have intentionally stopped distribution, modified versions can be created and redistributed at any time. Please link back to my original UDL as the source.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For everything else:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Please do not redistribute or modify unless stated otherwise by that specific work.</p></li>
</ul>
