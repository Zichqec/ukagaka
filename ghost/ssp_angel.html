	blurb: "A lovely shell that reimagines Pilot as a gijinka! This shell is packed with charm and vibrant expressions, and I 100% recommend trying it out. My other ghosts that folks have made shells for are generally simple things like <a href='../ghost/hydrate.html'>Hydrate</a>, where it doesn't have any expression changes or much dialogue to speak of. But this is different, since it's a ghost with fleshed out dialogue and a lot of expression. Seeing dialogues I wrote come to life but with slightly different nuance because of art variations (and sometimes silly discrepencies when the dialogues reference Pilot not having fingers) is such a cool feeling for me.<br><br>Comes with the same dressups as the original SSP Angel shell, as well as an additional hat dressup for Pilot!"
