<h2>About</h2>

<p><strong>Note: the Polish and French translations are unavailable in the latest version.</strong> They are available in <a href="https://github.com/Zichqec/FLUX/releases/tag/v1.2.2">v1.2.2</a> if needed, but mind that there are large differences between v1.2.2 and releases from v2.0.0 and onward.</p>

<p>FLUX is a spiritual successor to an old Japanese ghost called <a href="http://navy.nm.land.to/ukgk/flele/beginner.html">FLELE</a> (<a href="../blog/2024-10-13_flele_mirror.html">mirror</a>). FLELE is a music player which many people have created unique shells for! There are various <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/zichqec/favourites/87935078/flele-shells">collections of FLELE shells</a> spread across the internet. The one I have linked is only a small collection.</p>

<p>I created FLUX because I wanted to expand on the music player concept, and I wanted to solve certain issues that we were having with FLELE. Over the years it's grown from a messy project held together with duct tape and misguided dreams, and now has a polished music interface with many capabilities.</p>

<p>Main points to consider:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Polished music player interface with smooth navigation, hotkeys and hotspots for quick adjustments, multiple play modes, and various quality of life features.</p></li>
	<li><p>Supports multiple languages.</p></li>
	<li><p>Automatic network update checks, including for shells.</p></li>
	<li><p>Compatibility with FLELE shells.</p></li>
	<li><p>Supports many filetypes if using <a href="https://github.com/Nevcairiel/LAVFilters/releases">LAV Filters</a>.</p></li>
	<li><p>Can load and save .m3u playlists, the same format FLELE uses. Can also read .m3u8 playlists.</p></li>
	<li><p>Adjustable volume, speed, and left/right balance.</p></li>
	<li><p>Default balloon 'Notes' comes in both dark and light mode.</p></li>
	<li><p>Options to stop playback after the current song completes, or after the current playlist completes.</p></li>
	<li><p>If a song gives an error, it will attempt to play the next song instead of stopping.</p></li>
	<li><p>Notifies other running ghosts of information such as what song is currently playing, etc.</p></li>
	<li><p>Current song and shell information can be displayed in your Discord status if the <a href="http://ssp.shillest.net/plugin/discord.nar">Discord Rich Presence</a> plugin is installed.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>... And much more! I've poured a lot of time into making this a competent player that feels satisfying to use.</p>

<p>If you are interested in creating a shell, there is a template included within the files, which details some of the special features that FLUX has for shells. However, I discourage making shells with very complex functionality for FLUX. If it has a ton of content beyond just being a skin for the music player, then you should make a simple ghost instead! I have provided <a href="https://github.com/Zichqec/music_player/releases/latest">a template expressly for this purpose</a>, which has the same music player integrated. (<a href="../blog/2025-11-23_flux_v2.0.0.html#shell_system">Why you should not make complex shells</a>.)</p>

<p>If you're interested in having your ghost react to details from FLUX's music player, such as the currently playing song, you can find <a href="https://ukagakadreamteam.github.io/ukadoc/manual/list_shiori_event_ex.html#OnMusicPlayer.SongInfo">documentation for the stat share event on Ukadoc</a>.</p>

<p>If you are interested in translating FLUX to another language, please get in contact! There is some documentation for this in FLUX's files, as well.</p>

				"Added Russian translation by <a href='https://smokycinnamon.github.io/indifferentsorrel/'>Smoky</a>!",
				"Added German translation by <a href='https://koguri3108.tumblr.com/'>Koguri3108</a>!",
				"Added support for many audio file types, including .flacs, .oggs, and .m4as, which should work if you have <a href='https://github.com/Nevcairiel/LAVFilters/releases'>LAV Filters</a> installed!",
				"Fixed a bug in the shell template code that would mess up any shells that didn't uncomment the rest of that function. Sorry about that, completely my fault!",
				"Added support for dragging and dropping multiple music folders onto FLUX. This will search up to ~500 directories deep, so be wary if you have large subfolders. If you have more folders/subfolders than that, you'll have to do them in batches, as it will ignore any folders past the limit. Please note, with the limit set at 500, I have not had SSP crash on me. I can't say how it will behave for slower computers, though.",
				"Updated the yaya.dll, allowing for a new Emergency Mode! Now, if you load a shell with an error in its custom functions, FLUX will reload itself without the custom functions, allowing you to continue using it seamlessly!",
				"Changed how the music player reads file names, issues with escape characters should be a thing of the past! IF YOU HAVE SONGS SAVED IN PLAYLIST FILES WITH COMMAS IN THEIR NAMES, please go into those files and change the || that replaced each comma to a normal comma! Also, if you had set up communication features for your ghost with FLUX, please check the updated information in FLUX's commu file!",
				"Fixed an issue with installing FLELE shells if the files inside the zipped folder were nested in another directory.",
				"Changed the menu for moving songs to be a lot nicer. Also, fixed a bug that would allow you to move songs off the top or bottom of the list.",
				"Changed how the pronoun functions work- if you're a developer making a shell in a language other than english, please check the new pronoun functions for your language! I've included notes in the documentation about this.",
				"Updated the how to make a shell guide with updated and corrected information.",
				"The update dialogue will no longer call the singing animation repeatedly, unless you're in the master FLUX shell.",
				"The dressup menu will now redisplay the last surface when called, to allow for complex dressup systems using OnTranslateInternal or MAKOTO."

				"Added support for 3 other hotspots from FLELE: minimize, close, and a second stop button that is identical to the original.",
				"Updated yaya.dll to Tc564-1. This version adds new function modifiers to make creating dialogue pools easier!",
				"Slightly rearranged main menu if you have debug mode on.",
				"Updated music player menus to be slightly nicer when changing songs via the hotkeys/hotspots.",
				"Slightly changed how surfaces are called when singing. Hopefully this will smooth out issues where the singing animation would stop when changing shells.",
				"Fixed an issue where the music would stop if you changed shells right as it ended. There's a tiny window where this may still happen, but I don't think it's something I can change!",
				"Hopefully fixed an issue where if you closed the balloon while a song was waiting to play, it would not play the next song.",

				"FLUX now directly uses the <a href='https://github.com/Zichqec/music_player'>music player code</a> for YAYA that I have published. Many changes and additions were made as a result of this, which are listed towards the bottom.",
				"Added Spanish translation by Celeste.",
				"Disabled the French and Polish translations for now.",
				"Deprecated several of the shell customization options. They may be removed in future versions. If what you want to make is a shell with a ton of custom functionality/dialogue, you should just make a simple ghost instead! I have provided <a href='https://github.com/Zichqec/music_player/releases/latest'>a template with the music player built in</a> for this purpose.",
				"The shell loading system for custom functions has been overhauled and is much more solid.",
				"Updated old urls.",
				"Moved to a new homeurl. FLUX is now available in its own repository, where you can download any version.",
				"General code cleanup and formatting fixes.",
				"Improved the balloon color picker; color choice now affects input boxes and should also apply even when repeating a previous dialogue.",
				"Removed the update bar when performing a network update, to greatly improve update speed.",
				"FLUX's old stat share event has been deprecated and replaced with the stat share event from the music player code, called \"OnMusicPlayer.SongInfo\". The old event may be removed at some point in the future, if you currently make use of it please switch to the new one when you can!",

				"The wallpaper setting option has been removed.",
				"The low battery warning has been removed.",
				"The hemisphere setting has been removed.",
				"The option to set a birthday has been removed. That being said, some shells made use of the ability to comment when you set your birthday on the day of your birthday. This has been retained, but is now done by changing your birthday in the SSP preferences.",
				"Simplified the name configuration option.",
				"Talk rate switcher has been changed to a quick talk rate switcher.",
				"FLUX's shell creation and translation guides have been updated.",
				"Improved FLUX's ability to change shells while changing songs at the same time. This should only happen rarely.",

				"When creating a nar file, the link to open to the file location now highlights the specific file that was created.",

				"Reorganized the settings menu, there are now tabs for the various kinds of settings.",
				"The music menu is now paginated, and by default will display 10 songs per page. This greatly increases performance, and allows playlists of very long lengths (thousands of songs) to be used. This is toggleable in the settings menu.",
				"The above change DOES NOT APPLY to the move songs menu, and that menu will run very slowly for longer playlists. The button to access this menu has been moved to the \"advanced\" page of the settings menu, and a warning note has been added if there are a lot of songs in the playlist when that option is clicked.",
				"The help topics have been moved to their own dedicated \"Help\" menu.",
				"Added a song announcement option. If toggled on, the ghost can now announce the name of the song when a new song starts playing.",
				"It is now possible to drag and drop multiple folders at once and have songs loaded from all of them.",
				"Added the ability to use the scroll wheel to control volume, speed, and balance. Which it controls is changed in the settings, and it can be turned off entirely.",
				"Saving and loading of playlists is now handled via File Explorer. This enables playlists to be saved anywhere, allows for the possibility of subfolders for playlists, and makes it possible to create a shared folder of playlists for all ghosts with this music player.",
				"Dragging and dropping a .m3u file on the ghost will now offer to load it, instead of copying the playlist into the ghost's files.",
				"Clicking \"previous\" (or the respective hotspot or hotkey) will now jump to the start of the current song if it's been playing for more than a few seconds. This behavior can be toggled in the settings menu.",
				"Added a \"stop after playlist\" button. This works with both loop playlist mode, and shuffle and loop mode.",
				"There is a \"Prioritize\" option for preferring seamless music or dialogue. With the seamless music option, if the song changes while a dialogue is playing, the dialogue will be interrupted in favor of starting the next song. If you prefer the previous behavior of waiting until the dialogue completed to play the next song, choose the \"dialogue\" option for this setting.",
				"Fixed bugs related to the menu opening when hotkeys/hotspots were pressed, etc.",
				"Fixed an issue where when changing hotkeys, if a new song played or a hotspot or hotkey was used, it would no longer be possible to input a new hotkey without backing out of the menu and starting again.",
				"Changed various options to use anchor tags instead of choices colored like anchors, to make the display nicer in certain balloons.",

				".m3u playlists saved with a relative path format are now supported.",
				".m3u8 playlists are now supported.",
				"<strong>Despite the above changes, all playlists are still saved as .m3u with absolute filepaths. Any incompatible songs, directives, etc., will not be included when saving.</strong> Do not save over any playlists made by other programs unless you are willing to lose this information.",
				"Clicking on the title of the song listed as \"now playing\" will open the folder with the specific song highlighted, rather than just opening the folder that contains it.",
				"A live playtime display is now available in the settings menu, showing the total amount of time you've spent listening to music with FLUX.",
				"Updated to YAYA Tc571-13.",
				"And many, many, many bugs were fixed...",
