<p>Sidenote: if you want to make a Hydrate shell, here's a handy little <a href="../template/hydrate_shell_template.html">template</a> I made to make it easy!</p>

<article id="permissions">
	<h2>Permissions</h2>
	
	<p>A couple of special permissions notes when creating shells for Hydrate! See all of the permissions on my <a href="../permissions.html#ghosts">permissions page</a>.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>I don't really consider Hydrate to be a "character", so I don't mind if you make shells for it that are secondary works for another media.</p></li>
		<li><p>Moderate gore is OK!</p></li>
		<li><p>Sexual elements and nudity are not permitted. However, artistic nudity (such as statues) is permitted as long as genitalia and nipples are not shown.</p></li>
	</ul>
</article>

<article id="events">
	<h2>Events</h2>
	
	<p>I host a yearly event for Hydrate, called 8/20 Hydrate Shell Jam! It's an event where people create new shells on August 20th (8/20), in celebration of "Hydrate Day". Check them out below!</p>

			[
				"Hydrate will now have special comments based on how many drinks in a row you've hit!",
				"Changed the shell menu to dynamically change depending on what shells you have installed. Check the link in it if you want to download more shells!",
				"Added a dynamic dressup menu if the current shell has available dressup items!",
				"Added a stats menu to track your stats! Please note that most of these will start at 0 since they were just added.",
				"Added an option to tell Hydrate you took an extra sip of water! This won't count towards the timed drinks, but you still get some credit!",
				"Hydrate will now send your stats to other ghosts when pinged, and will ping them every hour with your stats! If other ghosts are set up to receive and process these stats, you might see your other ghosts comment on them!",
				"Added in the auto update system that I had removed for some reason. Hydrate will now check for updates once a day and let you know if there's something new!",
				"Unfortunately, it cannot automatically check for balloon and shell updates. There are buttons in the menu to check for updates for balloons and shells, make sure you check now and then for your favorite shells!",
				"Please note, if you're using the H2O balloon, that got an update as well. You should see larger balloons in the menus; if not, please ask Hydrate to update the balloon in the Config menu!",
				"The reminder balloon will now time out if you don't interact with it for long enough. This is set for 5 minutes by default, but it will be shorter if you set a shorter reminder time!",
				"If you're interested in having your ghost receive stats from Hydrate, or you'd like to make a shell for Hydrate, please check in Hydrate's folder for documentation!"

				"Added pause mode; pause your drink reminders when you step away from your computer, without losing your drink streak!",
				"Hydrate's auto update checks will now automatically check for updates to the current shell and balloon as well.",
				"Added an option to pick randomly from available designs.",
				"Added an option to toggle off hour notifications.",

				"Fixed the auto updates system, it now does what it says it does!",
				"Fixed a bug where the shell would not be placed correctly when changing shells.",
				"Fixed a bug where if you installed another ghost, the buttons to change to/call the other ghost had their labels swapped.",
				"Fixed some minor formatting issues.",
				"Changed the right click menu to include functions I had previously excluded.",
				"Changed the slider input when changing the reminder rate back to a normal input box. This should allow finer control, independent of balloon. Also you can set your reminders to absurd lengths now."

				"<strong>The old communication events have been deprecated and replaced with a new one.</strong> If your ghost has interactivity with Hydrate, please update when you're able! (The new information is currently at the top of commu.dic.)",
				"Added a \"random\" option to the notification sound picker. You can choose whether to include or exclude the custom sound you have set.",
				"Added interaction with the Wallet of Unyu plugin. Earn UNYU every time you take a drink, with higher amounts awarded the higher your drink streak is! (There is a cap of 100 on this.)",
				"Offscreen dialogue is now toggleable, and off by default.",
				"<strong>Updated homeurl. If you have a version older than this, you will need to update twice;</strong> once to update to the new url and then again to update to the latest version!",
				"Updated various urls, including credit urls.",

			changelog:
			[
				"<strong>The new stat sharing event has had some of the references change.</strong> I decided to change these quickly since the last update was yesterday and I hadn't completed the documentation yet. It's cleaner and hopefully easier to work with now! Sorry for any trouble.",
				"<strong>Scaling has been removed from the new stat sharing event.</strong> I realized that this information can be wrong if the user changes shells and doesn't change the scaling! It may return in the future if I find a solution.",
				"Hydrate can now deliver hydration reminders even while minimized! While minimized, drinks are not added to your stats and your streak is not affected. This is meant as a QOL feature for if you need to have fewer things on screen for a while but still want to get hydration reminders. This option is off by default so as not to be a nuisance. It can be toggled in the config menu.",
				"Fixed an issue where the custom sound option would cause an error if no sound was set.",
				"Hydrate now tracks your drink streak high score. This stat is also shared in the stat sharing event.",
				"Dressups are now shared in the stat sharing event. They are delimited with the special characters 0x01 and 0xFDEF. (If you are using a SHIORI that is not able to parse this for whatever reason, please let me know and I will consider adding an extra event for compatibility!)",
				"The stat sharing event now indicates if Hydrate is currently minimized.",
				"Removed the \"commu wait\" system, where Hydrate would store communication messages to respond to them after the balloon closed. This caused some strange effects and is generally unneeded now that that function is deprecated. Hydrate will immediately respond to all communication messages unless it is unable to do so (because a drink reminder or menu page is open). If this breaks any existing behavior, please let me know!",
				"Added back buttons to various menus, and unified the Done/Back/Cancel terms across all menus that use them.",
				"Removed update progress bars for faster update speeds.",
				"When picking a custom sound, if this action is closed on Hydrate's side it will now properly close the file picker window.",
				"Miscellaneous formatting adjustments.",
				"General code cleanup.",
