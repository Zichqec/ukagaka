				"The balloon will now attempt to resize based on the length of dialogue. This may be toggled off in the settings.",
				"Added a thumbnail.",
				"Updated the craftman and homeurl.",

				"Fixed an issue where sometimes the list of items would not be populated.",
				"Fixed an issue where items that were currently out would not be cleared upon resetting.",

				"Fixed a typo in the randomtalk, and one dialogue that was not capitalized properly.",
				"Fixed an issue where cubes lived for one second longer than they should have."
