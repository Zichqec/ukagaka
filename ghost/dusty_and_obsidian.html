				"Dusty's weather checking is fixed again, and there is now a toggle for Fahrenheit or Celsius in his menu. Please tell me if anything goes wrong with this!",

				"<a href='https://zdzisiu.github.io/Ukagaka/md.html'>MiniDev</a> can now hold Obsidian if both ghosts are up to date!",
				"Dusty also has some basic commu conversations set up with MiniDev, to hopefully be expanded at a later date.",
				"MiniDev has also been added to Dusty's submenu for talking about other ghosts!",
				"Changed the way S picking up Obsidian works. Please make sure you have both ghosts up to date before you try this! Also, if you ever have trouble with S/another ghost not picking up Obsidian anymore, reloading them seems to help.",
				"Offscreen dialogue should now happen immediately upon Dusty being moved out of bounds.",
				"Fixed a bug where timeout dialogue was happening when it shouldn't.",
				"Fixed some misc bugs and typos. Also, some code optimization. Expect a lot of optimization in 1.1.0, whenever I get to that..."

			version: "v1.0.8",
			released: "2020-11-06",
			changelog:
