				"Added several new dialogues (randomtalk, petting, booting, etc.).",
				"Added additional frames to the toppled bottle idle animations.",
				"Replaced the talk animation for the side gems.",
				"Fixed balloon flicker in the spell choice menu.",
				"Changed the cursor to a hand (grip) to indicate they are pettable, as well as make dragging them around more fun.",
				"Fixed an issue where the item menu would jump when selecting items if using some small balloons.",
				"When picking a random balloon color, it will now avoid picking the color that is already in use.",
				"Added basic QOL responses to some events (installing things, error messages for checking emails, etc.)",
				"Adjusted Firstboot sequence to avoid a flicker issue.",
				"Fixed an issue where they would not recognize a state change if they were moved in the middle of a dialogue, and then immediately closed before the dialogue could complete.",
				"Fixed the ghost menus being openable with right clicks.",
				"Normalized all idle animations to have the same chance of playing.",
				"Added an aigraph display to track the number of dialogues (functionality is limited unless debug mode is on).",
				"Fixed surface10 to act as a preview image for 3rd party services.",
				"Adjusted the shell settings to avoid interrupting animations when navigating the menus. (However, due to a bug in the current versions of SSP, this does not work yet. Keep an eye out for future SSP updates!)",
				"Fixed typos and adjusted formatting of some text.",
				"Cleaned up and simplified various parts of the code.",
				"Updated to Aosora v0.1.13.",
