<h2>About</h2>
<p>The original Xander's Refuge is an extremely simple ghost that I made in a month, with the goal of keeping it simple and just polishing it a lot. If you'd like to read more about the concept, read the page of the <a href="../ghost/xanders_refuge.html">original ghost</a>.</p>

<p>This ghost, however, is a port of that ghost from YAYA to Aosora, a new SHIORI at the time I'm making this! I created it to test out the language and see if it felt comfortable to create a ghost in. I figured if I could recreate all of Xander's functionality, then it was plenty capable as a language, and I would be happy using it for other ghost projects too.</p>

<p>I also thought it might help others adopt this new SHIORI if we could have a ghost written in both languages to compare! But that being said, please keep in mind this one very important caveat: I come from multiple years of writing ghosts in YAYA, and this is a port of a ghost written in a very YAYA way. So this port does not utilize Aosora to its fullest extent! A ghost written in Aosora from the start could likely make better use of its features.</p>
