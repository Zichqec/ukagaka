				"Restructured all of S's random dialogues, nearly all probability issues have been eliminated! His random dialogues should be much more varied now.",
				"S will no longer fall asleep randomly if you're the one prompting him to speak. He also won't wake up randomly if you're the one prompting him to speak, unless you get him into a chain nightmare. This should allow you to explore more of his dialogues without him randomly changing modes on you.",
				"If S just fell asleep, you now have around 30 seconds to double click him and wake him back up before he's fully asleep.",
				"Made the changelog nicer!",
				"You can now boop S's secret mode character!",
				"Fixed a bug where S would never stop drinking on some operating systems (hopefully).",
				"Fixed it so S's best dreams are actually available if you pet him enough while he's sleeping.",

				"Reworked the setup for booting, eliminated the bug where sometimes S would change into sleep mode even if he looked like he was awake when he booted.",

				"Expanded the gushing action, added a new confide action and waving action.",
				"Slightly rebalanced how much asking questions progresses you through friendship stages, among other tweaks.",
				"Added more dialogue for waking up, drinking, asking questions in the menu, recognizing some <a href='../ghost/hydrate.html'>Hydrate</a> shells, and more.",
				"Added dialogues for minimizing him, changing to a few specific ghosts, and poking him with <a href='../ghost/needle.html'>Needle</a>.",
				"Updated S's weather system, he now uses the <a href='../plugin/weather_station.html'>Weather Station</a> plugin to get weather. This means you will need to download and install the plugin if you don't have it, but the weather should be much more reliable in the long term, and will not cause massive lag spikes anymore.",
				"Unfortunately, this means S can also no longer get pollen data. Perhaps one day I will find a way to incorporate this, but I haven't yet.",
				"This also means that S recognizes a few new weather conditions as well, mostly to do with winter conditions.",
				"S can now optionally be pet with the mouse wheel instead of moving the cursor back and forth.",
				"The weekly dialogue system has been expanded, and S now has ~7-8 different dialogues muttering to himself each week.",
				"Added an easter egg if you flip S around backwards with shell scaling.",
				"Added an easter egg if anyone but me tries to use Tama on S.",
				"Improved internal handling of email headers significantly.",
				"Fixed a bug where you could never reach the final stage of petting in S's secret mode.",
				"Fixed an issue where double clicking S when he was waking up from a nightmare would cause him to not wake up.",
				"Fixed some typos.",
				"Removed the beta tester option since I no longer plan to use it.",
				"Rearranged a lot of code, simplifying S's dialogue pools.",
				"Lots of internal optimizations to make my life easier, including adding markdown processing. Hopefully this hasn't broken any old scripts, let me know if you see anything funky.",
				"Removed a bunch of test code.",
				"Updated YAYA to Tc571-3."
