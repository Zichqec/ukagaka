			changelog:
			[
				"Added 29 new random dialogues, bringing the total to 50.",
				"Added 2 new items.",
				"Added responses to being poked by Needle.",
				"Added special responses when poked by Needle in the Birthday Needle shell.",
				"Added many new item interaction dialogues.",
				"Added new guest personalities.",
				"Added a general response to OnCommunicate.",
				"Added Spectre calibration and responses.",
				"Added a response for LOBO's howling.",
				"Added responses for OnPhantaEepy.",
				"Added responses for OnCanToss.",
				"Changed behavior of OnCloseAll and OnGhostChanging, now instead of assuming a defeat it will first check if all items have been closed, and if so play the appropriate closing dialogue.",
				"Changed spawning cooldown time, it is now half of what it was. This makes guests despawn more quickly when the requirements to have them are not met.",
				"Many guests now leave silently, to avoid having a constant stream of goodbye messages tying up the ghost.",
				"Fixed an issue where the screen boundaries were improperly detected, causing some items to appear partially off the right side (or rarely the bottom) of the screen.",
				"Fixed an issue where the balloon was always detected to be open when spawning decorations or guests.",
				"Fixed an off by one issue where the number of other ghosts installed was counted improperly.",
				"Fixed an issue where her face would reset early if a decoration or guest spawned immediately after a dialogue finished.",
				"Under the hood cleanup, making it faster and easier to add new content in the future if we want to.",
				"Misc other tweaks and fixes.",
