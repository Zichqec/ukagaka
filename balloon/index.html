<h1>Balloon Index</h1>

<p>Balloons are the speech bubbles used by ghosts! Many English ghosts come with custom balloons, but balloons are separate from ghosts themselves, and—in general—you can use any balloon with any ghost. Note that this may result in odd text layouts at times if the ghost you're using planned for a specific balloon.</p>

<p>I love to make balloons. Many of the balloons listed here are the unique balloons that come bundled with my various ghosts, but many of them are ones I made just for fun! Some of the balloons are a bit old, but the difference in old balloons will mainly be older art and mess on the backend. They're still perfectly usable.</p>

<p>If you're a ghost developer looking for a balloon to use, feel free to use these! <strong>Unless marked otherwise,</strong> balloons listed on this page are free to bundle with your ghosts, and you're welcome to modify them to suit your ghost as well. Please refer to my <a href="../permissions.html#balloons">permissions page</a> for details about how you can use these balloons.</p>
