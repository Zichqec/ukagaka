<p><a href="../ghost/atm_machine.html">ATM Machine</a> has been updated to v2.0.2. This update was made primarily because I decided it would be nice to make the normal ATM dialogues not display instantly, but rather display a few characters at a time. There are some other minor adjustments as well.</p>

<p>Changelog:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Regular dialogue is no longer displayed instantly in most cases. Instead, the dialogue is displayed in chunks of 3 characters at a time, for a robotic feel.</p></li>
	<li><p>The "Repeat information" button in the menu is now visible but grayed out when no dialogue has been played yet.</p></li>
	<li><p>Adjusted menu choices so that they will word wrap on smaller balloons, etc.</p></li>
	<li><p>Various text tweaks and formatting adjustments.</p></li>
	<li><p>Updated a function called br to improve the display of text in some specific circumstances.</p></li>
	<li><p>Removed some unneeded code.</p></li>
	<li><p>Updated to YAYA Tc571-11.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As a fun aside, I originally tried implementing this function as whole words at a time. After taking a break and coming back to it, though, I found that it wasn't as satisfying as I wanted! So, I made a new function that would break it up by character count. This was a lot more tricky and potentially could have other side effects, so do let me know if anything displays strangely.</p>

<p>I've released the function I used to do this, if you're interested in implementing it in your own projects. It's called <a href="../code/index.html#chunktext">ChunkText</a>.</p>
