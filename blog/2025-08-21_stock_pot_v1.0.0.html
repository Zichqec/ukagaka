<p><a href="../shell/stock_pot.html">Stock Pot</a> is now available! It's a shell I made for the ghost <a href="../ghost/hydrate.html">Hydrate</a>. I had thought about making it for <a href="../event/8_20_hydrate_shell_jam_2025_rules.html">8/20 Hydrate Shell Jam 2025</a> if I had extra time after finishing my first two shells, but I wasn't feeling very well that day, so I didn't get the chance.</p>

<p>I decided to make today a rest day since I'm still feeling tired, and this idea wouldn't leave me alone, so I ended up deciding to go for it anyway and just pick at it throughout the day. I made it entirely with my mouse! Which is probably technically harder, but for some reason it registers in my brain as less effort.</p>

<p>Anyway, definitely check out the animations on this one. I'm particularly proud of how the "Simmer" animation came out, although it's not very visible on light backgrounds. It was an interesting one to figure out how to put together!</p>
