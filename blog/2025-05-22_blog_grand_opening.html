<p>Hello and welcome to the grand opening of Zi's Ukagaka Space's Blog! ... Or something. Zi's dev blog, Zi's ukagaka blog... Eh, it doesn't matter too much does it? What matters is that you're here and I've finally gotten this to a functional state.</p>

<p>From now on, I am intending to log all of my ghost dev activities on this blog. New releases, updates, announcements for events I'm running, etc. I want my history in the hobby to be archived somewhere, and this will be the place. Plus, it means that I'm finally properly announcing things to the world instead of just silently pushing them to the site.</p>

<p>As far as all of my dev history before this point, please refer to <a href="../2025-05-22_my_ghost_development_history.html">this post</a> which lists the release dates/times of everything I've published up to now, at least as best as I could gather them retroactively.</p>

<p>You might also try <a href="https://zichqec.tumblr.com/tagged/Ukagaka/">the #ukagaka tag of my Tumblr blog</a>, but be warned that most of the stuff there is quite old. I may still consider crossposting to Tumblr for things I'd like to have a little more visibility, but we'll see. I usually can't be bothered. Either way, everything should make it here.</p>

<p>If you'd like to keep up with this blog, it has an RSS feed that you can subscribe to. You can subscribe with your favorite RSS reader, or even subscribe with SSP so that you can use ghosts to check the feed for new content now and then. Just drag and drop the orange RSS icon on top of a ghost to subscribe to the feed.</p>

<p>This blog may also be used for the occasional opinion piece, dev rambling, or deep dive into a topic I find interesting. I can't make any guarantees though, as I have many projects to balance, so writing in-depth posts may fall to the wayside (except for Advent Calendar).</p>

<p>I wish this blog could have happened a lot earlier, since I'd planned to make it all the way back when I first launched this site overhaul, but due to various life events, I wasn't able to complete it until now. But with the completion of the blog framework, the structure is fully in place. All the work that remains on the site is to go through and fill in content on the various pages, and find a format I'm happy with.</p>

<p>That's not to say there will never be further improvements, I'm sure I'll always find something to fuss with here and there. But that will be incremental improvements over time, it shouldn't need to be major changes or overhauls like I've been working on lately.</p>

<p>I guess I haven't mentioned anywhere on the site what the recent changes are. A few months ago I suddenly found myself with the ability and energy to work on this website again, and have made the following additions:
<ul>
	<li>Index pages all have tags and a filtering option so you can filter for items with specific tags, or filter out items with specific tags.</li>
	<li>Index pages all have a sort option. By default, they're sorted alphabetically, ascending (except the blog which sorts by release date, descending). They can also be sorted by release date, last updated date (if available), and the order can be changed to descending.</li>
	<li>The advent calendar articles were moved out of the "other" tab of the navbar, and migrated to the blog page. I also brought over a couple of mirrors that were not linked on the navbar. Note that none of these pages changed URLs; it was always the plan for these to be listed on the blog.</li>
	<li>Created the blog index, added a pagination option (with the ability to disable it, for searching via Ctrl + F), and also added an RSS feed for it. The 10 latest blog posts are also visible on the website's front page.</li>
	<li>The website's front page now has banners for some documentation projects I've contributed to, a banner for Galla's site, and a banner for my site in case people want to use it. (I probably will not reciprocate if you link me, sorry. I'm not very interested in site buttons.) Also migrated the webring to this area.</li>
	<li>Most pages for ghosts/etc. have "read more" links which can direct you to their article on the Ukagaka Dream Team Wiki, or their page on Galla's website, or another website if they have a description there. My intention is to link to places where you can read interesting tidbits about them which I may not have covered in my page, so I'm not currently planning to link to places where it's just a basic listing with a download link. I might change my mind.</li>
	<li>Fixed some backend stuff so that the site now properly displays on the web archive. It's long bothered me that something about how the web archive handles the JavaScript made it so none of my pages display properly. I want this site to be properly archived if for whatever reason it drops off the web. So, I have finally found the cause and fixed it. (If you find a page that's still not working, let me know, please.)</li>
</ul>
... I've done a lot! This was a pretty big renovation project even though the core functionality of the website has stayed the same.
</p>

<p>At the moment I can't think of any other features that I really want for the site, other than maybe making an improved spoiler text display. There are some vague ideas knocking around in my head for other additions, but there's nothing that I strongly feel I'm lacking.</p>

<p>Well, maybe it could use a little more whimsy... Hmm...</p>
