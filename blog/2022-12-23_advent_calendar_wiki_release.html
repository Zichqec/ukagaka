	<p>This article is for the 23rd day of the <a href="https://adventar.org/calendars/8310">伺的 Advent Calendar 2022</a>.</p>
	<p>At long last, it's here: the much anticipated release of the Ukagaka Dream Team Wiki! This wiki exists both to document English ghosts and ukagaka related content, and also to provide information about ukagaka in English. We have pages on more than 100 ghosts, many balloons and shells, links to guides, external tools, and more! <a href="https://ukagakadreamteam.com/wiki/home">Check it out and browse around!</a></p>

	<p>You may have already seen this wiki; it's hard to keep under wraps while still allowing folks to edit! But if you saw it several months ago, I urge you to look at it again. we've been hard at work since September, getting most of the pages filled in and ready for this release. A lot has changed!</p>
	<p>Going forward, we hope that this will be <em>the</em> place to find links to and information about English ghosts and ghost-related content. And anyone is welcome to edit! If you can improve a page, or if you've found a page we're missing, then you are welcome to make an account and help us out! The wiki will be an ongoing effort, as new ghosts are posted and older ghosts are updated with new content, etc. And if you're an aspiring ghost developer, we'd love to be able to document your ghost on there, too! (Though if you don't want your ghost on our wiki, do get in touch with one of our moderators and we'll remove it for you.)</p>
	<p>Note that the scope of our wiki is a little limited, since we can't hope to document every single Japanese ghost in existence. Instead, we cover all English ukagaka-based content, and all content produced by any member of our community regardless of what language it's in. We also only cover content that is publicly released; so some ghosts that have only been released in our Discord server don't have pages here! It wouldn't be right for us to publicly release other people's content, after all. This also means that everything on the wiki is available for anyone to download, regardless of if they join our server or not.</p>
	<p>We hope you'll enjoy what our wiki has to offer!</p>
