<p>Release of a new set of functions: <a href="../function/index.html#encodemorse_decodemorse">EncodeMorse & DecodeMorse</a>! These functions can change text to and from morse code, or at least the written version of it where letters are separated by spaces and words are separated by slashes.</p>

<p>I included the standard codes, plus the nonstandard code for exclamation points because I figured that is a common enough symbol to want it. It's very easy to add more codes and customize how you like, as well! So if you want to have nonstandard codes as well, you can do so.</p>

<p>I made this during <a href="https://ukagakadreamteam.com/wiki/event/idea_adoption_jam_2025">Idea Adoption Jam 2025</a>, continuing my tradition of releasing new free code during jam... I'm not sure how it is I keep needing new functions I've never made before, and which are suitable for general use! I'll run out of good candidates for this at some point, surely.</p>

<p>What in our ghost uses morse code...? Well, you'll just have to find out! Coming to a desktop near you, a few hours from now... Look forward to it!</p>
