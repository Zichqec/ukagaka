<article id="postcontent">
<p>I have a <a href="../permissions.html">permissions page</a> now available on this site, detailing permissions for how my work can be distributed and used, etc.</p>

<p>Previously, some of this information (particularly for freeshells and balloons) was available on the index pages, but more and more I've been thinking I wanted to separate it out, both for a cleaner look and so I could detail permissions for other types of works as well.</p>

<p>Alongside this change, the ghost/etc. pages will each link to their respective section on the permissions page, if all has gone well. So if you're unsure of the permissions, it will act as a quick link to the right section for you.</p>

<p>Of course, there may be special permissions for individual works... I haven't decided yet if these will go right on the page for that item, or just be listed in the readme. I'll figure it out once I find some, probably.</p>

<p>Hopefully everything is clear. If anything is unclear, do let me know and I'll be happy to clarify it for you and update the page if needed.</p>

<p>I think as long as you read the introductory section, it will give you a pretty good overview of how I would like my works to be handled in general, and can serve as a guide for understanding the specific details.</p>
