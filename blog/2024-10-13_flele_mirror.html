<h1>FLELE Mirror</h1>
<img src="2024-10-13_flele_mirror/appearance.png" alt="FLELE's base appearance: a chibi girl with green hair and a white dress that has music player-esque details." width="136" height="176" class="centerimg">

<p>
This is a mirror download for the music player ghost FLELE. The original site can be found <a href="http://navy.nm.land.to/ukgk/flele/">here</a>.<br><br>

For many English-speaking users, the original site is inaccessible, giving a 403 error. You can often get around this by using the <a href="http://wayback.archive.org/">Internet Wayback Machine</a>, however, this service is currently down due to the Internet Archive being hacked.<br><br>

Thankfully, the original website says that redistribution of FLELE is permitted, so I have created a mirror here on my site. Use it if the original site does not work for you for whatever reason.<br><br>

This ghost is not mine and I do not lay claim to it in any way, it is listed here only for archival purposes/to ensure all users have access to it.

There is also an English translation created by Zarla, which you can download <a href="http://www.ashido.com/huntersmoker/flele.html">here</a>.
