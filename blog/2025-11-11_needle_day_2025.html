<p>It is Needle Day again! I woke up today to see a "Happy Needle Day" and it made me feel like it's a real holiday, hehe. Anyway, per the usual, we've got a Needle update and some new shells to share! Nothing extra this year, unfortunately—it's been a rough month for me personally so I'm just glad to have gotten this done on time. We hope you'll enjoy the new Needle content!</p>

<h2>Needle v1.1.5</h2>
<p><a href="../ghost/needle.html">Needle</a> has been updated to v1.1.5! We added relatively few dialogues this year, but, well... we couldn't just skip over the 1111 milestone! A few other little features and easter eggs have been added as well.</p>

<p>Changelog:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Added 111 new dialogues, bringing the total to 1111.</p></li>
	<li><p>Added a dressup randomizer. This can be activated by starting a mouse gesture and doing 5 circles in either the clockwise or counterclockwise direction (without doubling back).</p></li>
	<li><p>Added a rare boot dialogue.</p></li>
	<li><p>Spectre reactions, booting, and closing, all now get uwu text when using the Blushie shell with the uwu mode activated.</p></li>
	<li><p>General formatting/typo fixes.</p></li>
	<li><p>Updated to YAYA Tc571-13.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>New shells</h2>
<p>And now, without further ado... Here are the new shells by me and <a href="https://gallathegalla.github.io/gtg-ghosts/">Galla</a>! There are sure to be some other shells released this year besides ours, so I also recommend checking out the <a href="https://ukagakadreamteam.com/wiki/event/needle_day">Needle Day page on the Ukagaka Dream Team Wiki</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="../shell/3d_printed.html">3D Printed</a></h3>
<p>Modeled and printed by <a href="https://www.woogagoog.net/">Pommy</a>, and turned into a new shell by me! There are two styles, don't miss the second one which is available via dressups.</p>

<h3><a href="../shell/corkscrew.html">Corkscrew</a></h3>
<p>Is it a needle? Well, it <em>is</em> pointy and it <em>does</em> have what could be considered an eye...</p>

<h3><a href="../shell/embossed_needle.html">Embossed Needle</a></h3>
<p>A mostly-transparent needle that looks most interesting when over textured backgrounds!</p>

<h3><a href="../shell/expansive_needle.html">Expansive Needle</a></h3>
<p>This needle came about purely because I misread <a href="../shell/expensive_needle.html">"Expensive Needle"</a> as "Expansive Needle" and it made me laugh.</p>

<h3><a href="../shell/fashionable_needle.html">Fashionable Needle</a></h3>
<p>Dress Needle up so fancy! Make it cute! Make it cool! Make it goofy!</p>

<h3><a href="../shell/left-handed_needle.html">Left-Handed Needle</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://gallathegalla.github.io/gtg-ghosts/">Galla</a> made this! I contributed a beautiful needle of my own upon request!</p>

<h3><a href="../shell/needle_irl.html">Needle IRL</a></h3>
<p>I found some Needle merch at the store!</p>

<h3><a href="../shell/needle_of_needles.html">Needle of Needles</a></h3>
<p>To be completely honest, this is the whole reason the dressup randomizer got added. Have fun!</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/GallaTheGalla/robed_needle/releases/latest">Robed Needle</a></h3>
<p>Shell by <a href="https://gallathegalla.github.io/gtg-ghosts/">Galla</a>! This Needle seems it knows everything about everything and has all the best advice! I think I'll pledge my life to its cause.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/GallaTheGalla/sewing_machine_needle/releases/latest">Sewing Machine Needle</a></h3>
<p>Shell by <a href="https://gallathegalla.github.io/gtg-ghosts/">Galla</a>! It says not to put it in the sewing machine, but I bet it would have a lot of fun in there.</p>

<h3><a href="../shell/wiggly_needle.html">Wiggly Needle</a></h3>
<p>Laptops with drawable screens are a scam! Get a normal drawing tablet, it's cheaper AND it doesn't do this! How does anyone tolerate this!!</p>
