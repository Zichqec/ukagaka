<p>I wrote a new guide! <a href="../guide/writing_word_groups.html">Writing word groups</a> is now available for reading. It's a decently long guide that I wrote all about word groups (also sometimes called "envelopes"), detailing how I write them, what approaches I think are most effective, and various tips and tricks I've learned to fine tune them and use them for maximum effect.</p>

<p>I did this kind of on a whim after finishing <a href="../ghost/left_unattended.html">Left Unattended</a>. That ghost had several word groups, and I caught myself in the middle of my thinking process while creating them, and I thought it might be nice to write something about that process. Originally it was going to be just a little post on the <a href="https://forum.ukagakadreamteam.com/">UDT Forum</a>, but... well, things sort of spiraled out of control.</p>

<p>Why yes, it did take me a month and a half to finish updating Left Unattended. And then a single day's effort to crank out 10,000 words into a new document for this guide. (And then multiple editing passes to clean it up, believe it or not writing that much in one sitting does tend to leave a bit of a mess to clean up.) That's just how things happen sometimes.</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope that the guide is helpful for folks. I think this is the first time I've published a guide that's about writing and not about programming! That's scary and new. We'll see how it goes. Also, I hadn't realized that the last new guide I had written was apparently back in 2023? Although I guess I wrote some stuff for the wiki after that point, so maybe the year tags on this site are a little deceiving...</p>

<p>Either way, it's been a while since I've done something like this, and it being about writing is definitely very different from before. I'm really glad that I finally have all my thoughts about word groups in one place though, I love them so very much and finally I have something I can point folks towards.</p>

<p>If you have comments or feedback on the guide, you can get in contact with me in the usual ways, or I'll be opening a thread on the UDT forum for it!</p>
