<p><a href="../ghost/ye_olde_cursed_tower.html">Ye Olde Cursed Tower</a> has been updated to v1.0.1. This update smooths out various issues that were present in the initial release for Ghost Jam, and adds some other minor features.</p>

<p>Changelog:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Added several new dialogues (randomtalk, petting, booting, etc.).</p></li>
	<li><p>Added additional frames to the toppled bottle idle animations.</p></li>
	<li><p>Replaced the talk animation for the side gems.</p></li>
	<li><p>Fixed balloon flicker in the spell choice menu.</p></li>
	<li><p>Changed the cursor to a hand (grip) to indicate they are pettable, as well as make dragging them around more fun.</p></li>
	<li><p>Fixed an issue where the item menu would jump when selecting items if using some small balloons.</p></li>
	<li><p>When picking a random balloon color, it will now avoid picking the color that is already in use.</p></li>
	<li><p>Added basic QOL responses to some events (installing things, error messages for checking emails, etc.)</p></li>
	<li><p>Adjusted Firstboot sequence to avoid a flicker issue.</p></li>
	<li><p>Fixed an issue where they would not recognize a state change if they were moved in the middle of a dialogue, and then immediately closed before the dialogue could complete.</p></li>
	<li><p>Fixed the ghost menus being openable with right clicks.</p></li>
	<li><p>Normalized all idle animations to have the same chance of playing.</p></li>
	<li><p>Added an aigraph display to track the number of dialogues (functionality is limited unless debug mode is on).</p></li>
	<li><p>Fixed surface10 to act as a preview image for 3rd party services.</p></li>
	<li><p>Adjusted the shell settings to avoid interrupting animations when navigating the menus. (However, due to a bug in the current versions of SSP, this does not work yet. Keep an eye out for future SSP updates!)</p></li>
	<li><p>Fixed typos and adjusted formatting of some text.</p></li>
	<li><p>Cleaned up and simplified various parts of the code.</p></li>
	<li><p>Updated to Aosora v0.1.13.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>While it may not be something visible to users, I'm very happy with how much cleaner the code is after this update! I had a headache in the latter half of jam, and I knew that the code I was creating was messy and nowhere near my best. Now that it's cleaned up, I feel a lot more at ease.</p>
