<p><a href="../ghost/ssp_angel.html">SSP Angel</a> has been updated to v1.1.3! This update is primarily to bring SSP Angel's various informational dialogues back into agreement with SSP's English translation, since that translation was updated early this year.</p>

<p>Changelog:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Updated various tip dialogues to match the updated English translations in SSP.</p></li>
	<li><p>Some outdated or incorrect tips were removed or overhauled.</p></li>
	<li><p>Normalized certain terms and ways of displaying information to make it easier to understand.</p></li>
	<li><p>Added a few new tip dialogues.</p></li>
	<li><p>Added 10 new non-tip dialogues.</p></li>
	<li><p>Added a few extra responses to the screensaver ending.</p></li>
	<li><p>If attempting to check emails through Angel's menu, she will now prompt you to add an email address if you have none set.</p></li>
	<li><p>New option to check all email accounts at once if you have more than 1 set.</p></li>
	<li><p>The talk rate option has been replaced with a quick talk rate changer that has no commentary.</p></li>
	<li><p>Added error messages if a network update fails.</p></li>
	<li><p>Removed some links from the right click menu due to being outdated, or being overly specific. (Hopefully, there will be new links in the future to replace these.)</p></li>
	<li><p>Fixed typos, adjusted formatting, updated links, adjusted some grammar, clarified some wording.</p></li>
	<li><p>Updated to YAYA Tc571-13.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This update took a while to get through since I also wanted to go through and update various tips that were incorrect or outdated. A few tips have been completely disabled for now, and may or may not return in the future. It just comes with the territory, with this sort of project! I added in a few new tips though, so their pool shouldn't be any smaller.</p>

<p>Per the usual, I couldn't help myself and added a few other minor features too, as I came across parts where I found they would be useful. I clicked on the email check option in the menu and was surprised when I was presented with a blank list! So now it prompts you to set an email if you don't have one set. I also realized that I could add an option to check all accounts, so I did that too.</p>

<p>As for the talk rate switcher, that's been bugging me for a while. I've come to strongly dislike when ghosts guilt you in any way for changing their settings, and while I don't think SSP Angel's dialogues were too bad in this regard, they still bothered me. So, I cut them and replaced it with a quick talk rate changer, which has become a favorite of mine. This meant losing out on one bit of trivia that was in those dialogues, so I repurposed that trivia as a tip dialogue instead!</p>

<p>I wanted to get this update done a few days ago, but I've had a lot going on IRL lately, so it got pushed back a bit. Since I had some extra time, I decided to write a bit of idle dialogue for them as well, just to make the update that much nicer. It was fun to write for them again! Hopefully I'll get the chance to do it again soon.</p>

<p>I'd like to get some updates for other ghosts pushed this month, but due to the aforementioned busyness, we'll see what happens...</p>
