<p><a href="../ghost/hydrate.html">Hydrate</a> has been updated to version 2.0.1! This version comes with some new features and improvements.</p>

<p><strong>This feature introduces breaking changes for the new stat share event that was added last update.</strong> I have decided to do this because I realized the way I had done it was rather silly and I could drastically simplify it and make it a lot more solid overall. I would not normally introduce a breaking change like this, but since it was only available for 1 day and I had not released documentation for it, now is the time. Sorry for any hassle!</p>

<p>Also, I realized a problem with the scaling stat, so for now it has been removed... If I find a way to implement it properly in the future I will reintroduce it then.</p>

<p>Besides this, there are other goodies such as tracking your longest drink streak, being able to (optionally) send drink notifications even while minimized, and some bug fixes!</p>

<p>Code cleanup continues under the hood, and I hope to keep making big strides with it over the next few days. It's very satisfying to work on!</p>

<p>(The scope of this update feels like a 2.1.0, but the timing and the quick change to the stat share event demands it be a 2.0.1... versioning is a strange thing.)</p>
