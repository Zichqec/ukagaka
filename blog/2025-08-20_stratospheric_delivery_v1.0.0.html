<p><a href="../shell/stratospheric_delivery.html">Stratospheric Delivery</a> is now available! It's a shell I made for the ghost <a href="../ghost/hydrate.html">Hydrate</a>, as a part of <a href="../event/8_20_hydrate_shell_jam_2025_rules.html">8/20 Hydrate Shell Jam 2025</a>.</p>

<p>The shell features a free-floating cloud that looks great anywhere on screen, but especially near the top. It also is fun to place overtop of other ghosts you have open. (It looks great at smaller sizes, too!) It comes with an optional rain effect, and several dressups so you can mix and match the color of the cloud and the color of the rain!</p>

<p>I was a little uncertain if I'd be able to complete this in time for the event, but I made it! I'm very pleased with how it came out in the end. I was hoping I could get away with doing just 4 frames of animation for the rain effect, but it actually ended up taking 12 to make it properly appear to be falling down... rain effects are hard! I hope you'll enjoy it, and have fun placing other ghosts under or on top of it.</p>
