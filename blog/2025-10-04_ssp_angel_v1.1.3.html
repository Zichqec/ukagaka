<article id="postcontent"> //TODO i really need to decide if I'm going to have these kind of descriptive changelogs, or the list changelogs, or both...
<p><a href="../ghost/ssp_angel.html">SSP Angel</a> has been updated to v1.1.3! This update is primarily to bring SSP Angel's various informational dialogues back into agreement with SSP's English translation, since that translation was updated early this year.</p>

<p>Alongside that, I have gone through and unified certain terms and the way some information is presented to make it easier to understand, and I've also updated or overhauled some tips that were incorrect or outdated. A few tips have been completely disabled for now, and may or may not return in the future. It just comes with the territory, with this sort of project!</p>

<p>Some other minor features were added as well, as I came across things I found I could improve. For example, in Angel's menu you can ask her to check your email for you, and it's supposed to present a list of your configured email addresses to pick from. I apparently did not account for what happens if you have no email addresses configured at all! So I added a new message where she will explain you don't have an email address set, and will prompt you to do so, as well as offer help if requested.</p>

<p>Another thing I changed is the talk rate switcher. I wasn't fond of the way setting them to longer talk rates can have a guilting effect with their responses, and I've grown very fond of the quick talk rate changers that many of my ghosts now have. So, I updated them to that, and I even added a new interval they didn't have before (15 minutes). One piece of trivia that was in the talk rate comments has been turned into a random tip dialogue instead.</p>

<p>I also wrote a small amount of new dialogues, both tips and non-tips. I wasn't planning to write more for them right now, but I wasn't able to push this update yesterday like I wanted, so I figured I might as well use the extra day to add some additional content for fun. I'm also just finding writing for them enjoyable right now, so I might as well do it while I'm in the mood for it!</p>

<p>I'm hoping to get some updates for other ghosts pushed this month, but I've got a lot going on IRL right now, so we'll see what happens!</p>
