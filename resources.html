<h1>Resources</h1>

<p>Here are some resources I've collected! They're primarily for developers, but users may find something of interest here. The stuff on this page is not made by me, unless noted otherwise!</p>

<p>This stuff is gathered here partly for my own reference, and partly to help other folks getting into the hobby that are looking for information. There is a lot to explore here! And there's a lot more stuff out there on the internet. I'll probably add more to this page over time.</p>

<p>Note: if some of these links don't work, they may be directly linking to a file. You can try right clicking the link and choosing "Save link as...". Please let me know if any of the links here end up broken!</p>

	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://ukagakawebring.netlify.app/">Ukagaka Webring</a> - This is the webring that's linked on my front page! You can generally find people's personal sites for ukagaka here. A nostalgic way to explore the community!
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="http://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/">Zarla's Ukagaka Walkthrough</a> - This is a full walkthrough for making a ghost! If my guides don't cover enough for you/don't gel with you, maybe give this one a go! With this tutorial, everything is pretty much laid out for you and you'll primarily be replacing dialogue. There's some other information here as well. This was the first English resource ever for making ghosts, so it's been around a while and is sometimes out of date. But it's how I got started making ghosts!

</ul>

<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="http://ukgk.s34.xrea.com/poskoma/#content_1_11">Coordin</a> - This handy little program will help you make box collisions super quickly! Drag and drop your surface into it, drag and drop to make a box, and the coordinates will be copied to your clipboard so you can paste them immediately into surfaces.txt!
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="http://www.mediafire.com/file/943pv8g3bpyle1j/easydelete_v1.0.0.zip/file">easydelete</a> - A program to quickly add many files to delete.txt! Made by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Pommy15642">Pommy</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://jcmiller11.github.io/diceSim/coords.html">Image Coordinate Clicker</a> - Made by an acquaintance of mine, after I was musing about the possibility of a program that would let me quickly click points on an image to get coordinates for polygon collisions. If you're making polygon collisions for your ghost, this may make it easier! Just make sure you set the delimiter to commas.
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CXhw8hWpg4lNvgaswGa8NPXSvbAe8d8n/view?usp=sharing">png2pna</a> - A program that can make batches of pna files for your pngs. This is mostly outdated now, as there's no need to use pnas for anything but thumbnails these days, but if you have need of them it will make the process much easier! Made by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Pommy15642">Pommy</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="http://ssp.shillest.net/etc/seed.zip">SEED</a> - Shiori Event Emulator for Developers. You can use this to emulate SHIORI events and send them to your ghost!
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://github.com/YAYA-shiori/tama/releases">Tama</a> - A debugger for AYA and YAYA. This is an invaluable tool for any dev using AYA or YAYA. If you don't have it yet, do yourself a favor and get it.
		<br>
		Also of interest:
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="https://ukagakadreamteam.com/wiki/tool/tama_umeici">Tama (Umeici)</a> - The original version of Tama. It has some bugs, but if the new version doesn't work for you, this one may.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="misc/index.html#dark_theme_mod_for_tama">Dark theme settings file</a> - A little modification made by me, which changes Tama to a dark mode! Simply replace your tama.txt with this one while Tama is closed.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="plugins">Plugins</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="http://coderatte.ehoh.net/">Balloonmaker</a> - A handy plugin you can use to create a basic balloon, using a GUI within your ghost's balloon!
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://ukagakadreamteam.com/wiki/plugin/discord_rich_presence">Discord Rich Presence</a> - Display what ghost you're using as your Discord status! Some ghosts may even have special interactions with this.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="shiori">SHIORI</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="http://le.silk.to/akari.php">Akari</a> - C based, apparently very useful for creating SAORI.
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://github.com/kanadelab/aosora-shiori/releases">Aosora (蒼空)</a> - Inspired by Satori and Javascript. Aims to achieve the simplicity of writing scripts that Satori has, while also being flexible and allowing much more complicated processing. Unlike Satori, this one doesn't rely on characters in the Japanese character set, so it is more accessible to international developers! However, take note that development started in late 2024, so as I'm writing this it's still in very early days. Specifications may change, or development may halt.
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="http://umeici.onjn.jp/">AYA (文)</a> - C based, extremely simplified. Very outdated though, I recommend using YAYA, listed below.
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="http://kawari.sourceforge.net/">Kawari (華和梨)</a> - A SHIORI with a focus on "entries" and writing flexible dialogues with those entries. Some English ghosts are just starting to pop up that use this!
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="http://lovelove.rabi-en-rose.net/index_misaka.php">Misaka</a> - I don't know much about this one, but it apparently is suitable enough for making English ghosts in.
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="http://www.mikage.to/PerlShiori/">Perl Shiori</a> - PERL based.
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://phiori.github.io/">Phiori</a> - Python based, but unfinished as far as I know. Apparently has some issues where ghosts share space in memory, or so I'm told.
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="http://soliton.sub.jp/satori/index.php?FrontPage">Satori (里々)</a> - One of the most popular SHIORI for its simplicity to write in, especially using the Japanese IDE <a href="https://github.com/kanadelab/Satolist2">Satolist2</a>. It's not really suitable for English ghost development. The language is set up so that you can write a ghost without changing your input type between Japanese and English too often. But that means, if you're writing in English, this works in exactly the opposite way and makes you put in <i>more</i> effort!
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://github.com/YAYA-shiori/yaya-shiori">YAYA</a> - C based, extremely simplified. The continuation of AYA, providing bug fixes, security upgrades, and many new features. This is my SHIORI of choice, and most of the stuff I make will be in YAYA or catering to YAYA.
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="http://priest.so.land.to/ghost/index.html">Yuhna</a> - A SHIORI that comes with a GUI editor! The GUI is in Japanese of course, but theoretically, you could put together a basic ghost without needing to touch the code, much like you can do with Satori.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a list of various SHIORI <a href="https://gist.github.com/Tatakinov/cbaabd07069161e316a690b0e1ccbb69">here</a>, besides the ones I've listed. This list seems to cover smaller SHIORI that are mainly used to make existing programming languages act as SHIORI. These tend not to see as much use, probably because ghosts are often made by folks that aren't super into programming! So languages made specifically for ghosts that are simplified tend to be more popular.</p>

<h3>Windows</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="http://crow.aqrs.jp/">CROW</a> - Character Requested Operation Ware. Windows only, Japanese only. Has also long since stopped updating, and in fact, the download is no longer available on its homepage. However, you may be able to find it bundled with some old Japanese ghosts.
