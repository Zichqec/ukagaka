<h1>Template Index</h1>

<p>If you haven't noticed, I make a <i>ton</i> of ukagaka content. Browse the tabs at the top if you haven't, and you'll see many ghosts, balloons, guides, and more. I've tried making every type of Thing related to Ukagaka that I can, and I've poured thousands and thousands of hours into development and research to understand how all this stuff works.</p>

<p>And as a part of that, I've ended up making my own templates to make things easier on me! You may find them useful also if you're interested in ukagaka development, even if you just download them to look through them. Please note that I have learned a lot over the years, and my philisophy towards ghost making changed around 2022! So anything from before then is probably (definitely) outdated.</p>

<p>These links in the top section act as a quick index that will jump you to the different entries on this list.</p>
