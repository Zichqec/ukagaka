<h1>Guide Index</h1>

<p>I have written several ukagaka related guides, covering all kinds of topics, both for users and developers! The quality varies, as these have been written over the course of several years, and my skills in both technical writing and ghost making have improved greatly over time. So, do make sure you check the dates on them.</p>

<p>Some of these guides are also hosted externally, usually on the Ukagaka Dream Team Wiki. Any guides with an external link will indicate where they're going to take you!</p>

<p>Note that YAYA Fundamentals is currently listed last because this list is in alphabetical order, but it is the biggest and most polished of these guides. If you're looking to get into coding in YAYA, I'd recommend that one over everything else.</p>

<p>These links in the top section act as a quick index that will jump you to the different entries on this list.</p>
