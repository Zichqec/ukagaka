<h1>Guide Index</h1>

<p>I have written several ukagaka related guides, covering all kinds of topics, both for users and developers! The quality varies, as these have been written over the course of several years, and my skills in both technical writing and ghost making have improved greatly over time. So, do make sure you check the dates on them.</p>

<p>I am not perfect, I can and have made mistakes at times. If you find a mistake or something that is unclear, <b>please</b> tell me about it! You are not being a bother if you do so, you're being an angel and I will be so grateful. I want my guides to be as solid as possible, and feedback from readers is the only way to ensure that.</p>

<p>Some of these guides are also hosted externally. Any guides with an external link will indicate where they're going to take you!</p>

<p>Note that YAYA Fundamentals is currently listed last because this list is in alphabetical order, but it is the biggest and most polished of these guides. If you're looking to get into coding in YAYA, I'd recommend that one over everything else.</p>
