		version: "1.0.1",
		forevent: null,
		collaborators: null,
		download: "https://github.com/Zichqec/hydrate_shell_template/releases/latest",
		blurb: "A template for making shells for the ghost <a href='../ghost/hydrate.html'>Hydrate</a>! It's just a simple little thing I threw together to make life easier. You can use this to make other shells too, if you want a clean base to start from."

		name: "Minimum YAYA Template",
		type: "Ghost",
		release: "April 18th, 2022",
		latest: "April 14th, 2023",
		version: "1.0.0",
		forevent: null,
		collaborators: null,
		download: "https://github.com/Zichqec/minimum_yaya_template/releases/latest",
		blurb: "A template ghost for YAYA, with the bare basics and little else. It has the YAYA as SHIORI library, and the basic file structure, and that's pretty much it. You start with a blank main.dic file and a blank surfaces.txt file. It's meant as both an easy way to start with a clean slate, and also a way to show folks how little you actually need to have a ghost that runs."

	{
		name: "Simplicity Template",
		type: "Ghost",
		release: "February 4th, 2023",
		latest: "May 22nd, 2023",
		version: "1.0.4",
		forevent: null,
		collaborators: null,
		download: "https://github.com/Zichqec/simplicity_template/releases",
		blurb: "A simple ghost template with the philosophy that content is what matters, and everything else is secondary. If you've ever felt like other templates are too big or overwhelming, then give this a shot! Seriously, the whole menu file fits into a single screenshot, it's <i>tiny</i>. Of all my ghost templates, this is the one I generally recommend the most!"

		forevent: null,
		collaborators: null,
		download: ["https://www.mediafire.com/file/s9bbpku7o4zwrqc/x_template_balloon_v1.0.2.nar/file"],
		blurb: "A balloon with a rough and sketchy feel. Is intended for use as a template, and therefore has a minimal setup inside, with no left/right facing balloons, only a sakura balloon, and use of negative coordinates to cut down on the number of files necessary."

		download: ["https://www.mediafire.com/file/7tedi165c68tetq/x_template_yaya_v1.1.7.nar/file"],
		blurb: "This is an old template that I think is terrible! I cannot recommend against using it enough. However, if you're curious, or if you want to reference utility code and such out of it, then have at it! It is very much deprecated though."
