		blurb: "My first freeshell! This shell doesn't follow the recommended expressions, instead having its own more limited set that typically look grumpy or angry. It has 3 base surfaces, one with a 3/4 view, one facing straight forward, and one in profile looking to the left. Each comes with multiple expressions and arm poses that can be controlled with \\i[] tags. It also has the ability to be quickly recolored, by simply bucket filling some color files with your desired colors, allowing for some amount of customizability!",
