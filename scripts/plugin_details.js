		blurb: "A plugin for both users and devs, for getting weather data! As a developer, you can set your ghost up to recieve weather data from this plugin, to then do what you will with! Weather based comments? Outfit changes? Something else totally unrelated? It's up to you! This plugin will handle the messy details of the user inputting their location and gathering the weather data for you.<br><br>As a user, you can install this plugin to allow such ghosts to get weather data, and also to get a nice weather menu for yourself! The menu will display the current weather, the forecast for the next 3 days (including an hourly forecast), astronomy related data like when the sun will rise and set and the phase of the moon, and more! Note that the balloon shown here is arbitrary; the menu will show with the balloon of the ghost you access it from.",
