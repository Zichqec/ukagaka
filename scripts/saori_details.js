		blurb: "A SAORI-basic made for compositing images together, and my first foray into the world of SAORI. It was originally made to be used with the ghost <a href='../ghost/warrior_generator.html'>Warrior Generator</a>, although the intended functionality with that ghost is now better done by SSP's inbuilt surface dumper. Still, if you need some simple image compositing for something else, this may do the trick!"
