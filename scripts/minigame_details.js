		release: "January 5th, 2021",
		latest: null,
		version: null,
		forevent: null,
		language: "YAYA",
		download: "Continuous_Petting.txt",
		blurb: "This is an early bit of code I made to make it so that you can pet ghosts multiple times in a row and they'll notice and comment on it. They'll also track a high score for you, which is silly and fun. It's quite outdated, and I can make this much cleaner now. Maybe I'll update it someday, we'll see."

		name: "Digits of Pi",
		release: "March 14th, 2024",
		latest: null,
		version: null,
		forevent: null,
		language: "YAYA",
		download: "Digits_of_Pi.txt",
		blurb: "This is a little memorization minigame! You input the digits of Pi, one at a time, and they display in the balloon as you type. If you get one wrong, you lose! But it will tell you what it should have been, so you can get a bit farther next time. Comes with 10000 digits of Pi by default, but in theory you could set it to other strings! Or a more reasonable number of digits so that it's a winnable game.<br><br>Over the course of making this game, I went from 6 digits of Pi memorized to a bit over 40! It's surprisingly enticing to keep trying again and again."

		name: "Hangman",

		latest: "January 5th, 2021",
		version: null,
		forevent: null,
		language: "YAYA",
		download: "Hangman.txt",
		blurb: "My very first real minigame, a hangman game. Made with the help of my friend Nimanao! This was how I learned to use loops. It's pretty simple, but it can be fun if you give your ghost a list of themed words!"

		name: "Jumble",
		release: "November 4th, 2020",
		latest: "November 6th, 2020",
		version: null,
		forevent: null,
		language: "YAYA",
		download: "Jumble.txt",
		blurb: "This is a simple word jumble game! Give it a list of words, and then try to unscramble them! But despite its simplicity, guessing words when you don't know the category is really difficult. For an improved version of this game, see <a href='#word_jumble'>below</a>."

		name: "Rock Paper Scissors",
		release: "November 4th, 2020",
		latest: "January 17th, 2021",
		version: null,
		forevent: null,
		language: "YAYA",
		download: "Rock_Paper_Scissors",
		blurb: "My setup for rock paper scissors, which keeps track of how many matches you've played in the current game session, how many you've won/lost/tied, and the dialogue is set up so that it's all in one function and changes dynamically based on who picked what. You can set up surfaces to go with this, so that if your ghost picks rock it'll show that with its hands, but I have not done so yet so I can't show that in the example."

		name: "Tic Tac Toe",
		release: "April 7th, 2024",
		latest: null,
		version: "1.0.0",
		forevent: null,
		language: "YAYA",
		download: "Tic_Tac_Toe.txt",
		blurb: "A simple tic tac toe game! There are other implementations of tic tac toe out there, but mine aims for a hopefully more natural feel by letting the ghost comment on the moves it's making, and also not playing perfectly so that the user has a chance to win. Although, sometimes the moves it makes are pretty silly! How often the ghost will try to make smart moves is adjustable."

		latest: "May 13th, 2024",
		version: "1.0.1",
		forevent: null,
		language: "YAYA",
		download: "Word_Jumble.txt",
		blurb: "An improved version of my original Jumble minigame! This version prompts the user with a category, and asks them to solve 5 words in that category before they win. The number of words to guess is adjustable!"

		latest: "January 27th, 2021",
		version: null,
		forevent: null,
		language: "YAYA",
		download: "Word_Search.txt",
		blurb: "This is, currently, my biggest minigame. Look carefully at the comments in the code, and do what they tell you to do. But otherwise, I don't really advise looking in the rest of the functions. It's a lot and it's very complicated. It's definitely my favorite minigame I've made so far!"
