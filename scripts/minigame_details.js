		blurb: "This is an early bit of code I made to make it so that you can pet ghosts multiple times in a row and they'll notice and comment on it. They'll also track a high score for you, which is silly and fun. It's quite outdated, and I can make this much cleaner now. Maybe I'll update it someday, we'll see."

		language: "YAYA",
		download: "Hangman.txt",
		blurb: "My very first real minigame, a hangman game. Made with the help of my friend Nimanao! This was how I learned to use loops. It's pretty simple, but it can be fun if you give your ghost a list of themed words!"

		blurb: "This is a simple word jumble game! Give it a list of words, and then try to unscramble them! It's actually pretty difficult! Though I suppose the difficulty depends on the words you choose."

		download: "Rock_Paper_Scissors",
		blurb: "My setup for rock paper scissors, which keeps track of how many matches you've played in the current game session, how many you've won/lost/tied, and the dialogue is set up so that it's all in one function and changes dynamically based on who picked what. You can set up surfaces to go with this, so that if your ghost picks rock it'll show that with its hands, but I have not done so yet so I can't show that in the example."

		blurb: "This is, currently, my biggest minigame. Look carefully at the comments in the code, and do what they tell you to do. But otherwise, I don't really advise looking in the rest of the functions. It's a lot and it's very complicated. It's definitely my favorite minigame I've made so far!"
