<h1>Minigame Index</h1>

<p>Here are some minigames I've made that you are free to add to your ghosts if you'd like! Mostly they just require you to replace the dialogue, but there may be additional instructions in the files, so check carefully. Also note that I've improved a lot as a coder over time, so anything from before about 2022 could probably stand to have a lot of improvement. If you want to challenge yourself to improve my old code and make your own version, go right ahead!</p>

<p>I write in YAYA. Some of these minigames may also work on AYA, but I don't guarantee it. If you're still using AYA, <a href="../guide/convert_from_aya_to_yaya.html">you should upgrade to YAYA</a>, to give you access to <i>many</i> improvements, quality of life changes, and security updates.</p>

<p>Note that newer minigames may also require updated versions of YAYA! If you're not on the latest version of YAYA, <a href="../guide/upgrade_old_versions_of_yaya.html">consider upgrading</a>! As with upgrading from AYA, you get added features, bug fixes, and security updates.</p>

<p>Some of these minigames may be packaged as downloadable zip files, but others just say "View code". The ones that say "View code", you can simply copy and paste right out of your browser. They should direct you to a new page where you can select everything with Ctrl + A and then copy it out. If you want to download them, you can right click the "View code" button and click "Save link as..." or the equivalent in your browser.</p>
