<h1>Freeshell Index</h1>

<p>Freeshells are shells that you can use for free to make your own ghost! They are provided by artists such as myself as a development aid for those who can't or don't want to draw. They can be made in a variety of ways, so make sure you check the readmes to see what kind of expressions and other options are available!</p>

<p>I only have one freeshell available currently, but I hope to make more in the future! All shells listed here are free to use for your own ghost projects, all I ask is that you credit me for the shell, and that you don't use my work for anything commercial.</p>

<p>These links in the top section act as a quick index that will jump you to the different entries on this list.</p>
