<h1>Freeshell Index</h1>

<p>Freeshells are shells that you can use for free to make your own ghost! They are provided by artists such as myself as a development aid for those who can't or don't want to draw, or if you just need a quick shell for something. They can be made in a variety of ways, so make sure you check the readmes to see what kind of expressions and other options are available!</p>

<p>All freeshells listed here are free to use for your own ghost projects, with the following terms.<br/>

You must:
<ul>
	<li>Mention in your ghost's readme that you are using my freeshell. I can be credited as "Zichqec", with the following link: <a href="https://ukagaka.zichqec.com/">https://ukagaka.zichqec.com/</a></li>
	<li>Keep the readme file that is included with the freeshell as-is.</li>
</ul>

You may:
<ul>
	<li>Modify the shells, including recoloring, drawing new expressions, combining expressions, etc.</li>
	<li>Modify the settings files in any way you need.</li>
	<li>Use the shell to create a thumbnail image for your ghost, or a preview image for use on the ghost's release page, etc.</li>
</ul>

You must not:
<ul>
	<li>Use these freeshells to create commercial works.</li>
	<li>Distribute any version of these freeshells on their own.</li>
	<li>Use these shells for works outside the realm of ukagaka.</li>
	<li>Modify these shells to be discriminatory or political, or use it in a work that contains these elements.</li>
	<li>Modify these shells to add nudity or sexual elements.</li>
</ul>

In the event that a particular freeshell specifies different terms in its readme file, that freeshell's specific permissions take precedence. I would appreciate if you ensure that you are using the latest version of the freeshell, in case the terms have updated.<br>

You don't have to notify me if you use my freeshells, but if you do I would love to see what you've made!
