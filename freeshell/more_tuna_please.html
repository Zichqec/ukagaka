<h2>About</h2>

<p>A cute catboy freeshell with a silly/relaxed demeanor! His tail curls and uncurls as he sits on the desktop.</p>

<p>He comes with the standard expressions, plus variations for eyes pointing different directions, a couple of arm poses, and a few special expressions. There is also a blush and a sweat drop that can be applied to any surface with \i[] tags.</p>

<p>Not counting the blush and sweat drop, there are 135 different combinations of expressions + arms. If you use Satolist, I've already configured it for the surface palette so you can see them all!</p>

<p>If you use him, consider recoloring him to be another type of cat! You can use him as-is, of course, I just think it would be cute to see all different colors of cats made with this shell. I've included the PSD file to assist with these kinds of modifications.</p>
