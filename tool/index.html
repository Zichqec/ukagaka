<h1>Tool Index</h1>

<p>Tools are external programs made to aid in ghost development. Or at least, that's how I use the term! Tools can be anything, really. They can be full on GUI programs, or just little console applications, etc. And what they do can be just as varied! Maybe they'll help you with some tedious formatting, or they could convert files for you, etc. It's a very broad category.</p>

<p>When I'm making external programs, I typically write in Python. Sometimes antivirus programs don't like python .exe files! If you get any false positives, please let me know so I can report them. Please also note that as I work on Windows 10, these programs typically will not work on earlier operating systems. In particular I know Windows 7 won't run them. (Maybe one day I'll figure out how to fix that!)</p>

<p>Since tools are so varied, make sure you check their readmes for instructions! Something I get asked about a lot is programs that ask you to drag a file onto them. If it asks you to drag and drop a file onto the .exe file, that means <b>the .exe file is not to be double clicked!</b> Drag and drop the file on top of the tool's executable file in Windoes Explorer, and it should run for you! If they give you any trouble do let me know and I will be happy to assist.</p>
