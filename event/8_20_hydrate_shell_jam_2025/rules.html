<h1>8/20 Hydrate Shell Jam 2025</h1>
<img src="img/banner_start.png" alt="" class="centerimg" style="box-shadow:2px 2px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.10),-2px -2px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.10);">

<h2 id="what_is_8_20_hydrate_shell_jam">What is 8/20 Hydrate Shell Jam?</h2>
<p>Back in 2020 I created <a href="../../ghost/hydrate.html">Hydrate</a>, a simple drink reminder ghost, as a collaboration with <a href="https://zdzisiu.github.io/Cemetery/">Zdzisiu</a> on August 20th. I did this to celebrate the (fictional) holiday "Hydrate Day". <a href="TODO">The inspiration comes from this video.</a> (820 can be pronounced similarly to "H<sub>2</sub>O".)</p>

<p>Several people made shells for this ghost. The shells can be as simple as a single drawing, and people very quickly started getting creative with what was considered a "drinking vessel". It's turned into a silly and fun creative exercise!</p>

<p>8/20 Hydrate Shell Jam is an event I hold yearly that gives participants 24 hours to create a brand new shell for Hydrate. It celebrates both the anniversary of the ghost, and Hydrate Day!</p>

<h2>Timeframe</h2>
<p>This event will take place on <b>8/20 (August 20th)</b> from <b>12:00AM EDT</b> to <b>11:59 EDT</b>.</p>

<p><a href="TODO">Countdown timer for the start of the event.</a></p>

<p><a href="TODO">Countdown timer for the end of the event.</a></p>

<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>
<ol>
	<li><p>Create a brand new shell for Hydrate. You can create a shell from scratch, or use this <a href="../../template/hydrate_shell_template.html">Hydrate Shell Template</a> I made as a base.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Shells can be as simple or complex as you want. A shell that is a static drawing is a fine submission!</p></li>
			<li><p>Shells cannot contain sexual elements or nudity (artistic nudity, such as statues, is permitted if genitalia and nipples are not shown). Mild gore is permissible.</p></li>
			<li><p>Shells cannot contain elements created with generative AI.</p></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><p>To be considered a "valid" Hydrate shell, it must be something that can hold liquid, or be liquid itself. You can get creative with this! Cups, bottles, bowls, a shower head, a lake, a fire hydrant??? Have fun with it!</p></li>
	<li><p>Submissions cannot use direct download links, such as Dropbox or Mediafire. Please use a publicly accessible link, such as a personal website, a post on social media, or a Github release!</p></li>
	<li><p>Multiple submissions and teaming up are welcome!</p></li>
</ol>
