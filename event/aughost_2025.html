<h1>Aughost 2025</h1>

<h2>What is Aughost?</h2>
<p>Aughost is a guided personal challenge event that takes place in the month of August. You can consider it somewhat similar to events such as <a href="https://inktober.com/">Inktober</a>.</p>

<p>This event does not have rigid rules, nor does it have submissions. Instead, it's intended as a way to help you flex your writing muscles, and motivate you to work on your ghost projects!</p>

<p>The ultimate goal of the challenge is simple: to write new dialogue for one (or more) of your ghosts.</p>


<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>There will be 100 dialogue prompts provided throughout the course of the event, with 3-4 prompts posted each day. If you use every prompt, you will end the event with 100 new dialogues for your ghost.</p>

<p>However, you don't have to participate in that specific way!</p>

<p>Only want to write 1 prompt a day? You'll still end up with 31 new dialogues.</p>

<p>Only have time to write on the weekends? No problem at all, you could write for all of that week's prompts on the weekend if you'd like.</p>

<p>Only have time to participate for the first two weeks? That's still ~50 new dialogues!</p>

<p>Not interested in my list of prompts? Feel free to write your own, or just wing it! (However, I don't recommend this unless you're an experienced writer!)</p>

<p>Since this is a personal challenge, you can adjust things however you need to suit you. So long as you write something new for your ghost, you're succeeding.</p>


<h2>Picking a project</h2>
<p>You can write for any of your ghosts that you like! You can write for...</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>A new ghost.</p></li>
	<li><p>An existing WIP ghost.</p></li>
	<li><p>A ghost you've already published and want to update.</p></li>
	<li><p>A ghost you're planning to keep private.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Or whatever works for you!</p>


<h2>Prompt tips</h2>
<p>The prompts are here to inspire you, you don't have to follow them rigidly! I've tried to pick a lot of words that can have multiple interpretations, to make them as flexible as possible. (As a note, there may be duplicates from last year. I didn't reference last year's list when making this year's!)</p>

<p>You can use the prompts by...</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Using the exact prompt word in a dialogue.</p></li>
	<li><p>Using a variant of the prompt word in a dialogue. (ex: "starry" could also be used as "star", "starlit", "starstruck", etc.)</p></li>
	<li><p>Writing a dialogue themed around the prompt word, without using the word itself.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It is also perfectly fine if a prompt word jumps your mind to an unrelated concept, and you write that instead! The prompts are here to <em>inspire</em> you, so however that happens is perfectly fine.</p>

<p>And of course, if a particular prompt doesn't work for you at all, feel free to toss it out and come up with a new one! The ultimate goal here is to write dialogue, not to use all the specific prompt words.</p>


<h2>Sharing your progress</h2>
<p>It is highly encouraged to share your progress as you go! Sharing is a good way for us to keep each other motivated, and if you're struggling with a prompt you might be able to get some feedback.</p>

<p><strong>If you are directly sharing your dialogues, such as by sharing the text on Discord or Ukadon, please mark the post as a spoiler!</strong> This is so that other participants can write without being influenced by your interpretation of the prompts. After the end of August, this restriction is lifted.</p>

<p>You can also share your progress by updating your ghost throughout the event. There is no need for spoiler warnings in this case!</p>

<p>It is encouraged to share what you've made after the event ends by publishing your ghost/releasing a network update/etc. However, this is not required. There are no submissions for this event, so you can handle things however you like.</p>


<h2>Notes for this year</h2>
<p>As with last year, there will be a few days that receive an extra prompt word to bring the total up to a round 100. This year, it will the first day, the last day, and every Saturday.</p>

<p>Additionally, due to my current work schedule, I will not be able to post new prompts at midnight EDT as I did last year. Prompts may be posted closer to 8AM EDT.</p>


<p>That's all there is to it! If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me at my links at the bottom of the page, or on the <a href="http://discord.gg/uBPq8XF">Ukagaka Dream Team Discord server</a>. Good luck!</p>
