			released: "2022-08-25",

			version: "v1.0.3",
			released: "2023-07-19",
			changelog:
			[
				"Fixed an issue where if a location search only returned a single result, it would say there were none.",
				"Fixed an issue where the references in the daily forecast for average humidity and maximum wind speed in mph were swapped.",
				"Fixed an issue where metric time would not show the \"No sunrise\" etc. displays (I think, I did this so long ago I'm not positive).",
				"Made emdashes always appear in the font Calibri, to avoid tofus on balloons with special fonts.",
				"Added a \![no-autopause] tag to menus for ghosts using my autopause system, so that they should display menus instantly.",
				"Gave Weather Station its own github repo where changes can be tracked, and changed the homeurl accordingly. Find it here! https://github.com/Zichqec/weather_station"
			]

		{
			version: "v1.0.4",
			released: "2024-10-15",
			changelog:
			[
				"Updated permissions notes in main.dic and readme, since they were not entirely clear before.",
				"Removed the \"short numbers\" option for the air quality data, since weather API seems to now be shortening these numbers themselves.",
				"Updated some old links."
