	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>Weather Station is a plugin which gives you a one-stop solution to get weather data for ghosts. You can search your location by city, zip code, etc., and once you've selected a location, weather data will be broadcast to any ghost that is set up to receive it.</p>
	
	<p>You can view a simple weather display in the plugin's own menu, or ghosts may react to it if their developers have them set up to do so!</p>
	
	<p>The plugin also provides air quality data, astronomy data (sunrise and sunset times, moon phase, etc.), and 3 days of forecast data.</p>
	
	<p>Any number of ghosts can make use of the weather data, without needing to trust each individual one with your location.</p>

			released: "2022-08-25",
			changelog:
			[

			version: "v1.0.3",
			released: "2023-07-19",
			changelog:
			[
				"Fixed an issue where if a location search only returned a single result, it would say there were none.",
				"Fixed an issue where the references in the daily forecast for average humidity and maximum wind speed in mph were swapped.",
				"Fixed an issue where metric time would not show the \"No sunrise\" etc. displays (I think, I did this so long ago I'm not positive).",
				"Made emdashes always appear in the font Calibri, to avoid tofus on balloons with special fonts.",
				"Added a \\![no-autopause] tag to menus for ghosts using my autopause system, so that they should display menus instantly.",
				"Gave Weather Station its own github repo where changes can be tracked, and changed the homeurl accordingly. Find it here! https://github.com/Zichqec/weather_station"
			]
		},
		{
			version: "v1.0.4",
			released: "2024-10-15",
			changelog:
			[
				"Updated permissions notes in main.dic and readme, since they were not entirely clear before.",
				"Removed the \"short numbers\" option for the air quality data, since weather API seems to now be shortening these numbers themselves.",
				"Updated some old links."
			]
		},
		{
			version: "v1.0.5",
			released: "2025-06-10",
			changelog:
			[
				"When offline, the \"update available\" indicator will no longer appear.",
				"When offline or the weather cannot be fetched, the forecast and astronomy menus will be grayed out and inaccessible.",
				"Documentation has been updated to note the possibility that the \"No API response\" error may indicate the user is offline.",
				"Fixed a menu that would display with pauses when used with certain ghosts (those using \"AutoPause\")."

},
{
	version: "1.1.0",
	patches:
	[
		{
			version: "v1.1.0",
			released: "2025-06-18",
			changelog:
			[
				"Deprecated references 38-41 of OnWeatherStation.Weather, which previously contained the user's location data if they allowed this in the settings. I have decided that there is no use of this good enough to outweigh the privacy concerns, so these references have been removed entirely.",
				"Fixed an issue where the average visibility in kilometers was no longer available since v1.0.3.",
				"Added a thumbnail.",
				"Split the date and time formats from the metric/imperial setting. You can now control the date and time formats that are displayed in the plugin menu independently.",
				"Added YYYY-MM-DD as a possible date format.",
				"Adjusted the time display on the main menu to match the time display in the forecast menu.",
				"Fixed the location search menu having incorrect tags, causing an awkward display on some balloons.",
				"Changed some menu options to word wrap on smaller balloons.",
				"Cleaned up a lot of old code and improved performance in some circumstances.",
				"Reorganized code into multiple files and updated various informational comments, etc.",
				"Updated YAYA to Tc571-11.",
