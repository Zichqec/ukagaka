			version: "v1.0.3",
			released: "2024-12-15",

			[
				"Fixed custom calibration for ghosts with no expressions being broken. If you've used a ghost such as KEEP FROZEN with Spectre, please recalibrate it in the plugin settings after updating!",
				"Fixed the manual calbration for ghosts with alt expressions again. You'll need to recalibrate ghosts that use the alt expressions, sorry.",
				"Fixed the the calibration for the unamused expression not working under any circumstances.",

				"The option to repeat the last dialogue is now visible but grayed out if Spectre hasn't said anything yet.",
				"OnSpectrePlugin.Possession now includes some additional references. Your ghost can react based on Spectre's overall mood for the day, and can also react to dialogues that use spooky text effects.",
				"The behavior of various menu options is now consistent. They will all be grayed out when the plugin's effects are toggled off, instead of some of them disappearing.",
				"Fixed some missing tags that were causing inconsistent behavior.",
				"Some backend changes to it easier to add additional content in the future.",
				"Various typo fixes and wording updates."
