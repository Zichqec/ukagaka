<h2>About</h2>

<p>Spectre is a plugin which enhances your SSP experience! Download it today and see for yourself the incredible changes it provides!! If you don't like the effects, you can always toggle it off from its menu. It is recommended to use the balloon <a href="../balloon/ghost_balloon.html">Ghost Balloon</a> with this plugin.</p>

<p>For best results, make sure to calibrate the plugin individually for each ghost you use it with! Open the plugin's menu, and if the main menu has an option asking you to calibrate the ghost, make sure to click it. If that ghost's developer has provided a custom calibration, this step will be automatically completed when you open the plugin's menu with that ghost!</p>


<h2>Behind the scenes</h2>
<p>If you'd like to read more about the technical details of the plugin and my ponderings about it, please check out <a href="../blog/2024-12-22_advent_calendar_spectre.html">this article</a> I wrote about it for the [TODO NAME]. I would recommend spending some time with the plugin first though, to get an idea for how it works!</p>

<p>This might genuinely be one of my favorite ukagaka things I've created, it was a challenge but I think the results are really cool and unique.</p>
