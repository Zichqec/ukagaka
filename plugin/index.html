<h1>Plugin Index</h1>

<p>Plugins are addons for SSP that can add new functionality! They can, in theory, be anything. They can also be written in any programming language, as far as I know. But they can also be written in YAYA, and that is what I typically use!</p>

<p>Since plugins can take so many forms, the way you use each one will depend on what it is. Make sure you check the readmes! Note also that some plugins are made to be interesting/useful for general users, but others are intended as development aids for other ghost developers! If you're not a ghost dev yourself, you can ignore any development details listed.</p>

<p>In general, most plugins will have a menu of some sort that you can access by right clicking on a ghost, going to the <b>Plugin</b> tab, and clicking on the name of the plugin in question. But some plugins don't! Some simply send additional data to ghosts, and all you need to do is have them installed. Sometimes, it will be a mix of both these things.</p>
