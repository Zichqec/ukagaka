<h1>SAORI Index</h1>

<p>SAORI (Supplemental Archive Onto Restricted Intelligence) are a tool for ghost devs to use! They are used as a way to extend the ghost's capabilities beyond its chosen programming language. Since they can, in theory, be written in any coding language, the sky is the limit!</p>

<p>There are two different SAORI standards: SAORI-universal, which are .dll files, and SAORI-basic, which are .exe files. Most SHIORI support SAORI in some form, although which they support can vary. For example, SAORI-basic are natively supported by Satori, I believe.</p>

<p>YAYA, the language I typically work in, supports SAORI-universal natively, but not SAORI-basic. It can still run SAORI-basic through the use of a <a href="https://github.com/ponapalt/csaori/releases/tag/saori_proxy_ex_v1.0.2">proxy SAORI</a>, but this adds a little bit of lag into the process, which is unfortunate.</p>

<p>All of that being said, here are SAORI that I have made! Please note that antivirus programs tend not to like .exe files made in Python, so you may get false positives when downloading SAORI-basic. Please let me know if you do so that I can file a false positive report.</p>

<p>These links in the top section act as a quick index that will jump you to the different entries on this list.</p>
