<h1>404 - Page not found</h1>

<p>Sorry, that link doesn't lead to a valid page! Please use the tabs at the top to try and locate what you were looking for. I try not to erase my old ukagaka content off the internet, so it's probably here somewhere!</p>

<p>What link lead you here? If it's a link from this very site, please do get in contact with me on my social medias linked below so that I can fix it!</p>

<p>If you clicked on a link from somewhere else that lead to my old website, it will have attempted to redirect you to this website. But when I built this new site, some pages changed and got split up, which could be why you've landed here. If that's the case, definitely check the top tabs! If you're having trouble locating something, feel free to ask me and I can point you in the right direction.</p>

<p>Thanks for your interest in my creations!</p>
