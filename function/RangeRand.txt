//Get a random number within the specified range (inclusive by default). Even handles negative numbers!
//If you exclude either of the first two arguments, it will return nothing.
//If you write the arguments in the wrong order or you put in strings instead of integers, I don't know what will happen nor am I planning to cover those cases.
//Arg 0: The lowest possible value
//Arg 1: The highest possible value
//Arg 2: "exclusive" for exclusive range (1-10 would only output numbers from 1-9), leave blank if unwanted
//Example: RangeRand(1,10) will output a random number from 1 to 10
