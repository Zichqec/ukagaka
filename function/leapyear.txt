//This function will tell you if any given year is a leap year (hopefully, they might change the rules, you never know)

//Usage: Outputs a 1 if it's a leapyear, and 0 if it's not.
//Argument 0: The year to check. If omitted, it will use the current year.
//Example 1: if leapyear; "It's a leap year!"
//Example 2: if leapyear(year + 1); "Next year is going to be a leap year!"
