//This code automates adding simple information to SSP's AI graph, for if you want a simple count of things like your number of randomtalks, the number of entries in an envelope, etc.
//The AI graph can do a lot more besides just this! Read up about it on Ukadoc here: https://ukagakadreamteam.github.io/ukadoc/manual/list_shiori_resource.html#getaistateex
//Note: if things are set up wrong, opening the AI graph may cause SSP to crash. Just be a little cautious and make sure you follow the instructions.

//Each entry in this array is a new page that will be added to the AI Graph.
//You can add as many entries as you want, and each one will be a new page.
//You can add as many items to the entries as you want, just have at least 3 or SSP will crash when trying to load the graph.
//Obviously, if you add too many, it will at some point become very overwhelming to look at. You might try adding some sort of variables to control when each option is output.
//Make sure you write the NAMES of the functions/envelopes you want it to count, NOT a function call like %(name)
