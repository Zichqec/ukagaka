//To call the function, you can either call the function in your code like this:
//Shuffle("A string!") or Shuffle(SomeArray)
//Or in dialogue like this:
//"%(Shuffle('A string!'))" or "%(Shuffle(SomeArray))"
//It will automatically detect strings vs arrays. General purpose arrays will have their elements shuffled. Anything else is treated as a string, including simple arrays, and will have the characters scrambled.
//If you send more than 1 argument, it will not work, so don't do that.

	if GETTYPE(_argv) == 4 //If it's an array. General purpose arrays only!
