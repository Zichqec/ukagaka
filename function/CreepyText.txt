//To call the function, you can either call the function in your code like this:
//CreepyText("Your dialogue here!")
//Or in dialogue like this:
//"%(CreepyText('Your dialogue here!'))"
//If you want to change the max \w tag value, put the number you want as the second argument. If you want to change the max x and y values, put them as the third and fourth argument, respectively. You can set defaults in the function below.
