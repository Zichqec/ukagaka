This function should work in any YAYA ghost. Just copy the whole function into your ghost somewhere, and it should be applied automatically!
If you're using AYA, you can just copy over the entire if check into your normal OnTranslate function, and leave out the other lines of code.


How to write your dialogues with this processor:

This is some dialogue. Pauses will be inserted after punctuation marks, so long as there is a space after them! If you want to control the timing manually...\w8\w8\w8\w8 you can do that too. \n\nMake sure you add a space before linebreaks if you want the previous sentence to have a pause after it.\![dummy-tag] You can also purposefully not add a space (or put another tag in the way) if you want to omit the pause.

With the default setup, this would be the output:

This is some dialogue.\w8 Pauses will be inserted after punctuation marks,\w4 so long as there is a space after them!\w8 If you want to control the timing manually...\w8\w8\w8\w8 you can do that too.\w8 \n\nMake sure you add a space before linebreaks if you want the previous sentence to have a pause after it.\![dummy-tag] You can also purposefully not add a space (or put another tag in the way) if you want to omit the pause.


Pause tags are added after punctuation marks, but ONLY if that punctuation mark is followed immediately by a space. You can use this to control whether or not a pause is added at any point in your dialogue.

You can also add \![no-autopause] anywhere in a script to prevent pauses from being added in any part of the script! This is useful for things like menus.
Be careful that you don't have a comma and space combination in your sakurascript tags! As long as you write them like \![raise,OnThing,Arg 1] and not \![raise, OnThing, Arg 1], you should be fine.

You can adjust this all how you like. I also included options to handle ellipsis separately.
You'll have to be a bit mindful of how you write your dialogues, but this can make it much easier/cleaner in general!

Note: you could also change this to only add autopause if you specify a \![autopause] tag in the script, just by changing the if check! You could even get a bit more involved, and make it automatically check for certain events (like aitalk) and apply pauses to those but nowhere else. Whatever you need to make it useful but not a nuisance to you!
