//This function is intended to replace the functionality of an old SAORI that I found and couldn't get working. It lets multiple characters say different things at the same time.

//To call the function, you can either call the function in your code like this:
//Parallel(0,"Dialogue for the Sakura!",1,"Dialogue for the Kero!")
//Or in dialogue like this:
//"%(Parallel(0,'Dialogue for the Sakura!',1,'Dialogue for the Kero!'))"

//You can call any characters, in any order, and in any amount. Every other tag is a character tag, so you should write a number, the dialogue that goes with that number.
//%(Parallel(5,'Char 5 dialogue',37,'Char 37 dialogue',0,'Sakura dialogue',9,'Char 9 dialogue'))

//Please take care when writing the tags. I think I worked out all the infinite loop problems, but if your ghost ever crashes while using this function, do let me know and I'll see what I can do to fix it!

//You cannot write sakurascript tags within the Parallel tag, and if you want to write an apostrophe, you should write it as ##
