A little set of events and functions for making it possible to display text at the bottom of a balloon, regardless of what balloon the user is using.
Note that this setup is for the \b[2] balloon specifically, you'll need to make adjustmments if you want to use it for balloons other than that.
Note also that it is not suitable for all displays. If your menu text is too long, this will overlap with it! Be mindful how you use it.
This includes the SHIORI event OnBalloonChange, so if you already have that event in your ghost you may need to customize it to integrate this.

MAKE SURE you add the following to your OnFirstBoot, so that users get the correct display even if they never change balloons:
BalloonLines = 15

Set the 15 to whatever the default number of lines in your balloon is. If you're not sure what that number is, change to a different balloon and change back (after you implement the code below), then check the contents of BalloonLines.

Example usage: "\b[2]%(BottomText)Whatever you want displayed at the bottom"
*/

//This happens when the balloon is changed. If you want to use this for a balloon other than \b[2], you will need to change the \b[2] tag before the property command.
//I am sure you could create a setup for multiple balloons as well, if you needed, by running multiple property commands after different balloon tags and sending them to different events.
OnBalloonChange : all
{
	if "balloon" _in_ status; "\C"
	"\b[2]\![get,property,OnBalloonLines,currentghost.balloon.scope(0).lines.initial]"
}

//Event to save the amount given by the property command
OnBalloonLines
{
	BalloonLines = TOINT(reference0)
}

BottomText
{
	"\_l[0,0]\n[%((BalloonLines - 1) * 100)]"
}
