//Takes an integer or real number as an argument and outputs it as a string of numbers with commas as thousand separators.
//Example: 1234567890 â†’ 1,234,567,890
//Currently does not support other separation formats. You can customize it to your needs, or I may consider updating this in the future to support multiple formats with another argument to pick which one you want.
