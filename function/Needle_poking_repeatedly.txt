//Needle poking repeatedly
//Just a simple bit of logic for the OnNeedlePoke event, to make it so if the user pokes the ghost repeatedly the ghost can react to it.
//This can be useful for things besides Needle poking! Petting a ghost, pestering them with questions, etc. Whatever you can think of, you can can use this code as a starting point.
//For more information about the OnNeedlePoke event, see https://ukagakadreamteam.github.io/ukadoc/manual/list_shiori_event_ex.html#OnNeedlePoke

//The way this works is that when the ghost is poked, it tracks when it was last poked, and counts how many times it was poked. If 3 minutes elapse between pokes, the counter resets.
//So basically, if the user pokes at least once every 3 minutes, and does this 10 times, they'll get a special response for harrassing the ghost repeatedly. You can adjust the time and the number of pokes required to your liking.
OnNeedlePoke
{
	_time = 180 //Time in seconds that you want it to take between pokes for this counter to reset. Default 3 min
	
	if GETSECCOUNT > NeedlePoke.LastPokeTime + _time || !ISVAR("NeedlePoke.RecentPokes")
	{
		NeedlePoke.RecentPokes = 0
	}
	
	NeedlePoke.LastPokeTime = GETSECCOUNT
	NeedlePoke.RecentPokes++
	
	if NeedlePoke.RecentPokes >= 10 //How many times you want them to be poked within the timeframe before they react to it. You could add multiple stages here if you like, by checking for different amounts of pokes.
	{
		"Stop doing that, geez!"
	}
	else
	{
		"Ow, hey!"
	}
}
