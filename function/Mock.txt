//To call the function, you can either call the function in your code like this:
//Mock("some text")
//Or in dialogue like this:
//"%(Mock('some text'))"

//Note that by default, it will produce a 'perfect' mock case, meaning that it will change between lower and uppercase every character. If you want a 'random' mock case (which is really just randomcase, but some people say mock case is better with some chaos), put a 1 as the second argument. That'd look like this: "%(Mock('some text',1))"

//If you want to write an apostrophe in dialogue, write ## and it'll be replaced with an apostrophe

Mock
{
	_argv[0] = REPLACE(_argv[0],"##","'") //Replaces ## with an apostrophe, change it if you like
	_output = ""
	if TOINT(_argv[1]) == 1 //Random mock case
	{
		for _i = 0; _i < STRLEN(_argv[0]); _i++
		{
			_let = SUBSTR(_argv[0],_i,1)
			if RAND(2) == 1
			{
				_output += TOLOWER(_let)
			}
			else
			{
				_output += TOUPPER(_let)
			}
		}
	}
	else //Perfect mock case
	{
		for _i = 0; _i < STRLEN(_argv[0]); _i++
		{
		_let = SUBSTR(_argv[0],_i,1)
			if _let == " "
			{
				_output += _let
				continue
			}
			if _m % 2 == 0
			{
				_output += TOLOWER(_let)
			}
			else
			{
				_output += TOUPPER(_let)
			}
			_m++
		}
	}
	_output
}
